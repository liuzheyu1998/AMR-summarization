Speaker1:  it seems you two are a good match . what qualities do you look for in a friend ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  there ' s nothing definite i think . i don ' t have a list or anything , but when i first meet somebody , i can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend . it seems i have radar helping me spot new friends .  Speaker1:  well , that ' s something i ' ve never heard of . but if you ask me what i value most in a friend , i would say honesty .

Speaker1: for our lunch meeting with the investors , do we have to make a reservation at the restaurant or do we just show up ?  Speaker2:  usually for lunch , we don ' t have to reserve a table , they should allow walk - ins . but to be on the safe side , i ' ll order a table for half - past twelve . will that suit your schedule ?  Speaker1:  i ' ve arranged to meet them at the restaurant at twelve . can you make the reservation a little earlier ? if we start earlier , it will give us more time for a longer lunch .

Speaker2:  she loves to nit - pick and criticizes everything that i do . i can never do anything right when she ' s around .  Speaker1:  for example ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  well , last week i invited her over to dinner . my husband and i had no problem with the food , but if you listened to her , then it would seem like i fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . there ' s just nothing can please her .  Speaker1:  no , i can ' t see that happening . i know you ' re a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  it ' s not just that . she also criticizes how we raise the kids .  Speaker1:  my mother - in - law used to do the same thing to us . if it wasn ' t disciplining them enough , then we were disciplining them too much . she also complained about the food we fed them , the schools we sent them too , and everything else under the sun . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  you said she used to ? how did you stop her ?  Speaker1:  we basically sat her down and told her how we felt about her constant criticizing , and how we welcomed her advice but hoped she ' d let us do our things . she understood , and now everything is a lot more peaceful .

Speaker1: what do you like to do with your free time ?  Speaker2:  study english .  Speaker1:  you mean you like to study english ? why ?  Speaker2:  it gives me great satisfaction .  Speaker1:  studying english wouldn ' t give me any satisfaction . it ' s hard work .
 | 
Speaker1: so what do you feel like doing this evening ? how about going to the cinema ?  Speaker2:  ah , that ' s a good idea . but i heard the film club of our school would show a film for free . maybe we don ' t need to go to the cinema .  Speaker1:  that ' s good ! i ' ve also heard there will be a party held by the students ' union tomorrow evening . would you like to go with me tomorrow night ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  i ' d like to , but i ' m afraid i can ' t .  Speaker1:  why ? do you have to prepare for your examination ? oh , come on , girl , relaxation is also very important .  Speaker2:  that ' s not the reason . i have to go to the english corner tomorrow evening . you know , i ' ve been going there every week .  Speaker1:  oh , god , i ' ve forgotten it . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  you said you wanted to improve your english , so how about coming with me tomorrow ? i can also introduce some friends to you .  Speaker1:  oh , no , i don ' t want to know any more geeks like you .  Speaker2:  they are not geeks . they are also interested in singing , dancing , and so on . they are excellent , and they can always help me a lot .  Speaker1:  really ? is there a foreign teacher for every class ?  Speaker2:  it depends . if they are not busy , they will come to join us , and talk with us .  Speaker1:  so you just talk all the time ?  Speaker2:  of course not . the foreign teachers also teach us english songs , and play games with us . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  that sounds interesting . i ' ll go with you tomorrow evening .

Speaker1: have you ever found yourself in a situation when you have to lie to people who trust you ?  Speaker2:  do you mean lying to people for their good ?  Speaker1:  yes . is it wrong to lie to them even if it is for their good ?  Speaker2:  it ' s hard to say . i mean , how can you judge what ' s good for them ? maybe it is best to tell them the truth no matter what it is .  Speaker1:  but sometimes it is so hard to tell the truth .
 | 
Speaker1: it ’ s so relaxing , taking a walk in the country . the air is so fresh and clean . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  would you like to live in the country ? i ’ m not sure i ’ d like it .  Speaker1:  i can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage . the problem is that , for me , each advantage has its own disadvantage .  Speaker2:  what do you mean ? _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  well , i hate the noise in the city , but i love being around lost of people . the problem is that you can ’ t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . the two just don ’ t go together .  Speaker2:  i see what you mean . i love being far away from a city , but i hate being so far away department stores and sports facilities .  Speaker1:  people can ’ t have it both ways . if you live in the country , it is often less convenient . if you live in a city , it is noisy , but there ’ s more to do . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  i would love to be surrounded by hills and streams . they ’ re so much better to look at than concrete , rows of parked cars and tall buildings .  Speaker1:  i would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face . when the wind blows in the city , you get dust in your mouth and in your eyes .  Speaker2:  the view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing . there ’ s so sign of pollution . the village looks so peaceful . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  just remember that in that village there ’ s nothing to do . there ’ s not even a pub or restaurant . there ’ s just one small shop with a poor selection of goods .
 | 
Speaker1: hey , zina . you ' re here early today .  Speaker2:  yeah , i ' m going to be making phone calls all day . what a blast . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  i just wanted to say thanks for putting us on the map so fast . i appreciate it .
 | 
Speaker1: what ' s your number ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  i ' m number seven . what about you ?  Speaker1:  five . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  hah hah ! you have to go before me .  Speaker1:  you think it ' s funny . i ' m terrified .  Speaker2:  don ' t worry . it ' s safe .  Speaker1:  but i ' ve never jumped off anything in my life . the highest thing i ' ve jumped off is my bed . i ' m scared . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  you are the one who wanted to come here , sandy . you should enjoy it .  Speaker1:  i guess i ' m adventuresome , but then i ' m scared too .
 | 
Speaker1: what ' s the weather like ?  Speaker2:  i don ' t know . i just woke up . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  why don ' t you look outside ?  Speaker2:  okay . it looks like rain . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  why do you say that ?  Speaker2:  the sky is gray .  Speaker1:  is it raining right now ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  no .  Speaker1:  how do you know ?  Speaker2:  the street isn ' t wet . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  i have to go shopping today .
 | 
Speaker1: darling , i have news for you . bobby and his wife , evelyn , are going to have a baby soon . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  really ? i thought his wife couldn ’ t have a baby .  Speaker1:  actually they ’ re expecting the baby to come on my birthday . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  oh , what a coincidence ! i bet bobby must be very happy about it . he likes children and always wants a child of his own .  Speaker1:  in fact , they ’ re both very excited about the coming baby . evelyn imagines what their baby would be look like , since one parent is american and the other one is chinese .  Speaker2:  oh , right . now i know why they would want to see our boy . it ’ s hard to imagine the wonder ! are they expecting a boy or a girl ? _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  it ’ s still a mystery . because evelyn is only three - month pregnant . but she begins to take her maternity leave now .
 | 
Speaker1: let ' s do something really nice for our family this christmas . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  what did you have in mind ?  Speaker1:  i don ' t know yet .  Speaker2:  i just know i want to get out of the mindless gift trap . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  i know what you mean .  Speaker2:  i want to give a gift that is really meaningful .  Speaker1:  or do something that shows we have spent time thinking about them .
 | 
Speaker1: there is a tornado warning on . my mother just told me she heard it on the radio .  Speaker2:  what is a tornado warning ?  Speaker1:  it means that a tornado has been seen somewhere in the area . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  really ? in new berlin ?  Speaker1:  no . not necessarily in town . but in southern wisconsin somewhere . a tornado has been spotted . they have two stages here . this is what is called a " tornado watch . " that means that the weather conditions are perfect for a tornado . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  i understand . they think a tornado might come .  Speaker1:  yes . people should look out , because maybe there will be tornadoes coming . so it ' s called a " watch . "  Speaker2:  and the second stage is called a " tornado warning " .  Speaker1:  yes . if a tornado has been spotted , they announce a " tornado warning " . so if there ' s a tornado warning on , it means a tornado is out there somewhere . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  it ' s scary .  Speaker1:  well . tornadoes can be dangerous , it ' s true . if we hear something like a loud train coming , then we have to go in the basement .  Speaker2:  what do you mean " a loud train " ?  Speaker1:  that is what tornadoes sound like . they sound like trains . they ' re very loud . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  but if you hear them coming , isn ' t it already too late ?  Speaker1:  maybe . it depends on the tornado . some can move across the ground at 200 miles an hour . that is very fast . others aren ' t so fast . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  have you seen a lot of them ?  Speaker1:  i ' ve only seen one in my life . i was looking out the window . it was around two miles away . it was very interesting to watch . but it was heading toward my friend ' s house . so i quickly called them on the phone .  Speaker2:  did it hit their house ?  Speaker1:  no , it didn ' t . but they are glad i called them .  Speaker2:  what were they doing when you called ? _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  they were all sitting in the living room watching tv . they had no idea a tornado was coming toward their house . if it had hit them , they could have all been killed .

Speaker1: oh , my god ! i ' ve been cheated !  Speaker2:  what ? what did you buy ? _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  it ' s a brick ! i can ' t believe how stupid i was . damn it !  Speaker2:  what is it ? why did you buy a brick ?  Speaker1:  there was a guy on the sidewalk . he had three new boxes , panasonic video camera boxes . he said he had to get rid of them quick . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  and ?  Speaker1:  so he said he ' d sell me one for twenty dollars . a four - hundred - dollar camera for twenty bucks . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  and it ' s a brick ?  Speaker1:  yes . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  i can ' t believe how stupid you are . why didn ' t you open the box ?  Speaker1:  i wanted to . but he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store . if it ' s opened , other people won ' t believe it ' s new . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  so he had the boxes wrapped in plastic .  Speaker1:  yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products . look , it even had a bar - code price sticker on it ! it looked brand new . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  but why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ?  Speaker1:  he said he had to get rid of them . they were stolen .  Speaker2:  aha ! now i understand . you were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk . so , what i think is , you deserve to get cheated ! _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  c ' mon , don ' t blame me ! i thought it was a new camera . we could use it . we were even thinking about buying a camera . i don ' t understand how he could have such a perfect - looking box .
 | 
Speaker1: don ' t be afraid . give it a try .
 | 
Speaker1: i don ' t think we ' ve met .  Speaker2:  no , i don ' t think we have .  Speaker1:  my name is dick brown .  Speaker2:  how do you do ? mr . brown . i am susan heywood . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  mr . smith often talked about you .
 | 
Speaker1: hi bill , i saw your grandma yesterday .  Speaker2:  oh where was that ?  Speaker1:  i was running around the track at my college and there she was walking around the same track . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  grannie always tries to stay fit and healthy . she is always making us kids eat the proper foods .  Speaker1:  well , it pays off for her . how old is she anyway ?
 | 
Speaker1: it sounds that you have a high opinion of him .  Speaker2:  he is an all - right guy . i have no bone to pick with him .  Speaker1:  birds of feather flock together . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  but he is not a fine wether friend who could sell you down the river .  Speaker1:  you cannot judge a person that way . i have a hunch that he is a sly dog .
 | 
Speaker1: i am going to celebrate my birthday with you all in a night club this year , what do you say ?  Speaker2:  fantastic ! i enjoy clubbing , especially those clubs with live bands . the only fly in the ointment is that the air is bad , full of smoke , and the music is too loud , so conversations are not really possible . once i nearly got burnt by a cigarette . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  how did that happen ?
 | 
Speaker1: it ' s a lovely day , isn ' t it ?  Speaker2:  yeah , and most excitingly , i met the girl living under me today . she ' s really nice .  Speaker1:  is she american ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  yeah , and most importantly , she ' s single ! man , i could tell from the moment i saw her , she ' s the girl of my dreams !  Speaker1:  so i take it you two are hitting it off ? i know it ' s very convenient to be in a relationship with your neighbor , but what if you break up ?  Speaker2:  i don ' t know . i am not really worried about that . i don ' t wanna lose before even starting . besides i think the other two american guys have also fallen for her . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  sounds like you ' ve got some competition . you made a move already ?  Speaker2:  not yet . but i am thinking of inviting her to dinner sometime . i know some good restaurants nearby .  Speaker1:  that ' s nice . having been here a little while surely gives you the advantage , eh ?  Speaker2:  you bet . now that you mentioned it , i think i ' ll call her now and see if she is available tonight . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  good luck !
 | 
Speaker1: thank you for your letter .  Speaker2:  is your waist any better ?  Speaker1:  yes , i ’ m feeling very well these days .  Speaker2:  i ’ m glad you are getting better .

 | 
Speaker1: you don ' t look too well . maybe you should take the day off from work .  Speaker2:  i couldn ' t do that . i have an important meeting to go to today . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  do you feel ok ?  Speaker2:  not really . after a 12 - hour flight , i ' ve got jetlag , and on top of that , i think i ' ve also got the flu .  Speaker1:  why don ' t you call your secretary and tell her to reschedule the meeting ? you should really get some seat or you ' ll end up feeling even worse than you do now . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  could you feel my forehead and check to see if i have a fever ?  Speaker1:  you ' re really hot . let me get you some tylenol to bring the fever down .  Speaker2:  ok . i ' ll stay home this morning and rest , but if i feel better in the afternoon , i ' m going to the meeting . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  zach , what ' s that on your arm ?  Speaker2:  i don ' t know . it looks a bit red , but i ' m sure it ' s nothing .  Speaker1:  it looks like you have a red rash all over you ! are you allergic to anything ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  just cats , but i don ' t think i was near any cats in the last couple of weeks .  Speaker1:  i completely forgot about your cat allergy . i took care of a cat for my friend here a few days ago . oh no . we ' d better go to the doctor to get some medicine . let ' s go . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  shouldn ' t we make an appointment first ?  Speaker1:  we would , but let ' s just go and see if there ' s an opening now before it gets worse .

Speaker1: i ’ ve had it ! i ’ m done working for a company that is taking me nowhere !  Speaker2:  so what are you gonna do ? just quit ? _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  that ’ s exactly what i am going to do ! i ’ ve decided to create my own company ! i ’ m going to write up a business plan , get some investors and start working for myself !  Speaker2:  have you ever written up a business plan before ?  Speaker1:  well , no . it can ’ t be that hard ! i mean , all you have to do is explain your business , how you are going to do things and that ’ s it , right ?  Speaker2:  you couldn ’ t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has , history , etc . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  well , that seems easy enough .  Speaker2:  wait , there ’ s more ! then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . what they are and how they are different from competitors ’ ? then comes the hard part , a market analysis . you need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables ! you need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from gdp per capita to how many children on average the population has ! all this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage , where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea .  Speaker1:  geez . is that all ?

Speaker1: the company is selecting three employees to attend the marketing seminar next month . did you put your name in for it ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  no , i don ' t really care too much for seminars . . . i find them to be either boring ot useless . i mean , how much can you really learn in one afternoon ?  Speaker1:  it ' s not just about the things that you learn , you know . . . seminars are a really great opportunity to mingle and network with professionals in our industry from all over the nation . you can learn a few things , but more importantly , you rub shoulders with the business leaders and make contacts that could lead to potential sales or partnerships in the future . the social mixers are always more important than the seminars anyway .  Speaker2:  i ' m still not too jazzed about going . . . i feel kind of awkward in those cocktail party situations . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  well , what if i told you the seminar is going to be held in hawaii ? does that perk your interest ?
 | 
Speaker1: are you ready to go the concert ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  yes . should we go there by bus so we aren ' t late ?  Speaker1:  actually , why don ' t we go there by bike ? we could get stuck in traffic if we travel by bus in rush hour . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  that ' s true . cycling is good for our environment , too . let me just get my helmet then .  Speaker1:  is your helmet comfortable ?  Speaker2:  not really , but i liked the design , so i got it .  Speaker1:  maybe you should think about getting a round helmet ; they ' re better . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  i ' ll think about it .  Speaker1:  is that your new bicycle ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  yes , my father gave it to me for my birthday . do you like it ?  Speaker1:  it ' s the newest 10 speed cycling mountain bike . these are really expensive ! _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  nothing but the best from my dad . i like everything about it except for the brakes . they are a bit sticky .  Speaker1:  i can fix those for you . is there anything else wrong with it ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  well , my saddle is too low for me . do you know how to change the height ?  Speaker1:  that ' s easy . it ' s important to have the saddle high enough so that your legs can extend fully when you are on your bicycle .
 | 
Speaker1: another weekend is coming ! _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  and we ' re going to have summer vacation .  Speaker1:  yes . what will you do this weekend ?
 | 
Speaker1: are you going to watch the indy five hundred on tv this weekend ?  Speaker2:  i ' m not really into racecar driving . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  you were when we were in high school . that , and baseball .  Speaker2:  yeah , well , times change . look at you - you ' re a father now . you can ' t say that you haven ' t changed .  Speaker1:  true , but i still have to watch my baseball . the season ' s in full swing now .

Speaker1:  i have a large family . i have three older sisters , my twin sister , a younger brother , and parents . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  i didn ’ t know you were a twin ! are you identical or fraternal ?  Speaker1:  we ’ re identical . i mean , we look exactly the same , but we are complete opposites when it comes to everything else .  Speaker2:  interesting . it must be great having a twin sister . are you best friends , too ? _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  we used to be really close , but that all changed once she moved to shanghai . how about your family ? you didn ’ t mention to your biological father .  Speaker2:  i don ’ t know much about him . he died when i was just a baby . even though i don ’ t have a blood relationship with my step - father and step - brother , i consider them to be my real family .  Speaker1:  what about your step - brother ’ s mother ? does he keep in touch with her ?
 |

Speaker2:  of course not . people all over the world watch it on tv , or listen to it on the radio . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  sure . it ' s one of the biggest classical music events . have you ever been to the live show ?  Speaker2:  yes , i went to the new year ’ s concert in 2010 . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  wow , you ' re so lucky . i saw it on tv . but it must be so different to be there in the concert hall .

Speaker2:  what are your main concerns ? _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  well , it would give me a chance to grow , but i am wondering if i would like the job .  Speaker2:  i know what you mean , i ' ve thought about that myself .  Speaker1:  i am also thinking about the pay . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  could you take a slight pay decrease for a chance to move forward ?  Speaker1:  yes , it might be worth it . i am not certain .

Speaker2:  what ? why ! i am taking an intercontinental flight ! i ’ m flying sixteen thousand cms ! how am i supposed to only take two , twenty kilo bags ? that ’ s absurd !  Speaker1:  i am sorry , sir , there ’ s nothing i can do . you cannot board the flight with that large bag either . carry - on bags must fit in the over - head compartment or under your seat . that bag is clearly too big .  Speaker2:  now i see . you charge next to nothing for an international ticket , but when it comes to charging for any other small thing , you charge an arm and a leg ! so tell me , miss , how much will i have to pay for all of this . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  let ’ s see . . . six hundred and twenty - five us dollars .
 | 
Speaker1: how ' s your new job going ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  really well , thanks .

Speaker1:  would you rather have her or your old boss back ?  Speaker2:  she ' s far better than my old boss . he didn ' t know how to express his opinion without putting at least one other person down . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  how about your new co - workers ?  Speaker2:  they are all pretty easy - going . it ' s a very friendly place to work . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  do you miss your old co - workers ?  Speaker2:  of course . i spent so much time at my old workplace that i got to know them all very well . they were like family to me . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  do people in different departments get along with each other ?  Speaker2:  sure . since we work together in teams , we have to get along with each other . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  do you like working in teams with people from different departments ?

Speaker1: what is the most unexpected thing you experienced in space ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  i wasn ' t quite prepared for the view of the earth as we left . it was just awe - inspiring . it emerged from just a slightly curved horizon to a whole earth , where you could look across oceans and continents in a single glance . i wasn ' t quite prepared for that . it ' s inevitably etched in my memory .  Speaker1:  when viewing the earth from space , do you feel detached from humanity or more a part of the totality of humankind ?  Speaker2:  detached . you ' re literally detached from one planet , captured by another . your only link to reality is the earth out there ; fortunate - 1y , it stays in view the whole time . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  there ' re a lot of suspicions that the international space station is never going to become reality . is it going to be some future project that never happens ?  Speaker2:  i believe it ' s certainly for real . it without question has suffered a lot of delays . but there ' s hardware sitting on the pad right now and it ' s due to go off in december . it is a reality . it has just taken longer to get literally off the ground . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  there were a lot of talks during the bush administration about a not too distant future mars mission . it seemed to fizzle out . do you think that this shuttle mission will reignite the public ' s passion for space and get us to mars sooner ?  Speaker2:  i hope this flight is not just a one - time affair , that it does re - ignite people ' s interest to push on . but only time will tell . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  you had gone to the moon twice , orbited space around the earth lots of times , and of course you have had the most amazing views that a human being can have . how long do we ordinary beings have to wait to feel the weightlessness ? i just can ' t wait .
 | 
Speaker1: hey , look at the offer i got in my e - mail . it says that i can get rich quickly while working at home ! _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  do you also believe in santa claus and the tooth fairy ?  Speaker1:  what do you mean ?  Speaker2:  i mean that you ' re gullible . you shouldn ' t believe everything you read , especially on the internet . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  but it seems like a good idea . all i have to do is first send some money to the person who sent me the letter . after that he ' ll tell me how to earn much more money .  Speaker2:  sounds like a pyramid scheme . have you heard of those before ?  Speaker1:  pyramid scheme ? what is that ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  it ' s a scam 7 that ' s based on a hierarchy , like a pyramid . the person at the top asks the people below him for money , and then tells them to go and ask other people for money while sending some of it back to him .  Speaker1:  sounds good to me . the guy at the top gets money and so do the people below him . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  not exactly . the scam keeps on going , with the people at the bottom paying more and more money until they reach the very bottom .  Speaker1:  what happens then ?
 |

Speaker2:  of course . but i ' m afraid i ' m not much of a dancer . . .  Speaker1:  don ' t worry . i ' m not much of a dancer myself .  Speaker2:  you ' re dancing so well .  Speaker1:  you dance beautifully too .  Speaker2:  when did you learn to dance ?

 | 
Speaker1: if you go out recently you will find some people riding scooters in high streets and back lanes . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  yes . the german engineer would never dreamed that the hand - supported scooter he invented several years ago to solve his traffic problems would become so fashionable in the occident within a few years and even spread to japan and china .  Speaker1:  looking at the ' five sense organs ' of a scooter , it can be said as delicate and agile . to pull the t - shaped pole and make it vertical with the flat board and then pull it vertically , adjust its height suitable to you and you may use it .
 | 
Speaker1: finding an excuse is obviously down your alley . and trying to avoid taking care of the children is what you are good at .

Speaker2:  i know . he doesn ’ t like to ask anyone for help . my dad insists on paying his own bills and taking care of himself !  Speaker1:  that sounds like my grandmother . she was always stubbornly independent .  Speaker2:  it seems that folks like my father and your grandmother are determined to be on their own .  Speaker1:  they see their independence as a kind of character strength .
 | 
Speaker1: guess what ! i know something you don ' t know !  Speaker2:  what ' s that ?  Speaker1:  how many planets are there in the solar system ?

Speaker2:  nice try . i wasn ' t born yesterday , you know .  Speaker1:  i ' m dead serious . they ' ve decided that it ' s too small to be a planet , but actually they haven ' t yet agreed on how big something has to be in order to be a planet anymore . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  that sounds crazy . but they can ' t just change their mind about things like that .  Speaker1:  yes , they can . if you remember correctly , people used to believe that the world was flat .  Speaker2:  i suppose you ' re right . they also used to think that they were so important that the sun revolved around them , not the other way around . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  we actually know relatively little about space and the cosmos .  Speaker2:  do you think that we ' ll one day be able to travel to another planet for a vacation ?  Speaker1:  i suppose we could actually live on a planet outside of the milky way .  Speaker2:  do you think we ' ll ever get to meet an alien from outer space ? _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  i hope not . i think they would be a threat to those of us that lived on the earth .

Speaker1: now that you ' recommending such enormous fees , producers , directors , movie - makers must see you in a completely different light .  Speaker2:  yeah .

Speaker2:  that happens in many places . in my city , there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . the police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes , but i don ’ t know if that ’ s the reason for our relatively low crime rate .  Speaker1:  some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .

Speaker1: today more and more people advocate lifelong learning . but people have different views about lifelong learning . how do you understand lifelong learning ?  Speaker2:  i think lifelong learning is the concept that it ' s never too soon or too late for learning  Speaker1:  does that mean studying all the time ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  i don ' t think so . i think it ' s about your attitude towards learning . one should be open to new ideas , decisions , skills or behaviors .  Speaker1:  then the axiom - ' you can ' t teach an old dog new tricks ' doesn ' t work any longer . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  you ' re right . lifelong learning is about finding learning opportunities at all ages and in numerous contexts  Speaker1:  yes , i agree with you . when i retired i will participate in programs to keep momentally active .

Speaker1:  yes , i do . i ’ m learning chinese now on the internet .  Speaker2:  how do you find studying a language on the internet ? _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  it ’ s not easy , particularly with listening and speaking , because sometimes the connection isn ’ t too good .  Speaker2:  i bet you find the character difficult to write ! _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  actually , many of the characters are the same or very similar in both chinese and japanese , so they ’ re easy for me .  Speaker2:  so , you can read and write much better than you speak and understand other speakers , right ?  Speaker1:  yes . how are the spanish classes going ?
 | 
Speaker1: how do you usually get to school ?  Speaker2:  i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ? _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle , but when i feel lazy , i drive my car .  Speaker2:  i think we should discourage people from using their private cars . they produce too much pollution !  Speaker1:  i agree , but i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it ' s just so convenient .  Speaker2:  cars might be convenient , but they ' re so bad for the environment .  Speaker1:  do you have a car ?  Speaker2:  no . i used to have one though . once i started using my bicycle to get around , i found that i didn ' t really need it .  Speaker1:  maybe if i sold my car now , i wouldn ' t be so tempted to use it .  Speaker2:  you could try . it would save you a lot of money . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  that ' s true . every month , i spend hundreds of dollars on gas , insurance , and repairs .  Speaker2:  if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving , you will get lots of exercise , too !  Speaker1:  i could stand to lose a few pounds . having a car has made me lazy . i never end up walking anywhere !
 | 
Speaker1: could you do me a favor ?  Speaker2:  what is it ?  Speaker1:  could you possibly give me a lift home ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  all right .  Speaker1:  are you sure ? i don ' t want to inconvenience you .

Speaker1:  about 70 , i think . this newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population . it ’ s a problem that will soon affect most of the world . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  i heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age , because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly .  Speaker1:  perhaps we need to have more babies ! tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday .  Speaker2:  did she ? that ’ s great . however , if we have too many children , that will have a bad effect on the enviroment . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  how ’ s your son these days ?  Speaker2:  oh , he ’ s fine . kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays .  Speaker1:  he ’ ll be a teenager before you know it ! teenagers are often rebellious ! when do you mine it is a good age to have a child ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  i had mine when i was 24 . that ’ s a little young . i ’ d suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties . , or even in your early thirties if you have a good career .  Speaker1:  yes , i think you ’ re right . i ’ m thinking about having a child , but not just yet . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in you country ?  Speaker1:  yes , there is . teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . they want to go out , have fun , and explore the world . they want to develop their own view of life . parents usually try to discourage them , but they don ’ t often succeed .

Speaker1:  excellent . i see you have the 18th century poetry class for next semester . and the modern novel class . you haven ' t taken a shakespeare class yet . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  no , i thought i would take it later .

 |

 | 
Speaker1: what do you think are the main causes of war today ?  Speaker2:  i ’ d say the main reason is poverty . countries and their people get frustrated because they have so little . if their neighbors have some resources , they try to steal them by military force . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  it seems that a lot of wars nowadays are really civil wars . people from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country .  Speaker2:  several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . it seems they will never end . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  how do you think they could be ended ?  Speaker2:  i don ’ t think that there is any easy way . the united nations could send peacekeepers into the country . at least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . the thing is to find the real problem form the war and solve that . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  so , if the cause is poverty , there should be a program to make the country richer . if the problem is resources , share them .  Speaker2:  it sounds easy when you say it like that . in reality , it ’ s harder to make peace between countries . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  yes . it is . one way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . wars are very expensive .

Speaker2:  i ' ve had that problem too many times . so i learned to save . when i ' m writing something , i save every three sentences or so . i don ' t want to lose anything .

Speaker1:  i don ' t know . i feel like going out .  Speaker2:  i wonder how much of the city is down . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  it doesn ' t matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .

 | 
Speaker1: i don ' t know why people are just mad about david peckham . is there really anything so fascinating with him ?  Speaker2:  he appeals to the fans thanks to two things  Speaker1:  you mean he plays well ? yeah , he often scores by free kicks in crucial games . but a football match is by no means merely a show of taking free kicks .  Speaker2:  certainly not . what really counts is to play as a team , passing the ball amongst each other , dodging defenders . free kicks are a result of all the teammates ' collective efforts . however , a few free k  Speaker1:  in the case , maybe facial charm should be his leading card . after all , the majority of his fans are girls .

Speaker2:  he ’ s not bad . he can jump a distance of over four meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . jimmy ’ s very good at the high jump . he can jump over two meters . again , that ’ s fine for someone hi  Speaker1:  two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at long - distance running ?  Speaker2:  the longest race we run is the 1500 meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  how are they at swimming ?  Speaker2:  they ’ re ok . i ask them to swim 500 meters each day . that ’ s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . they ’ re not very fast , but that ’ s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .  Speaker2:  i ’ d be afraid to jump from that height !  Speaker1:  i think that these kinds haven ’ t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height , but she soon wanted to go higher .

Speaker2:  yeah , yeah , but today ’ s lesson was all about the creation of the universe .  Speaker1:  a physics class about the creation of the universe ? that ’ s some pretty unscientific language there . sounds more religious to me .  Speaker2:  it ’ s all religion . take the theory of the big bang . how is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion ? that ’ s no better than atlas carrying the globe on his back or african myths about turtles and stuff .  Speaker1:  turtles ? whatever . . . look , all that ’ s required for the creation of matter an imbalance of particles and anti - particles . at least , that ’ s what the math says .  Speaker2:  math , sheath . what ’ s the evidence ?

 | 
Speaker1: i usually bowl with an eight ball . i like the control of a light ball . i can spin it more , so that the ball hooks .  Speaker2:  well . i like them a little heavier . i don ' t have as much control , usually bowling straight , but the extra momentum compensates for that . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  well , let ' s see which technique is better . i think i ' ll go up first . . . yes ! i hit a strike . i knocked them all down on my first bowl .  Speaker2:  well done . you got them all . you get 10 points and your next two bowls are added to this frame ' s score . i ' ii dry my ball off and try to knock them all down as well .  Speaker1:  good start . you knocked eight pins down . but you are left with a 7 , 10 split . unless you can bowl a ufo - ball on this bowl , it is going to be impossible .

 | 
Speaker1: hey , mike . you ' ve been surfing the net for quite a while . what on earth are you searching for ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  it ' s something relative hackers . i often hear people talking about them , but i don ' t know much about them .  Speaker1:  well , roughly speaking , a hacker is a computer buff .  Speaker2:  you mean a guy using enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the computer ?  Speaker1:  you can say that . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  but why are people always having such a negative attitude towards them ?  Speaker1:  they must have mixed hackers with crackers .  Speaker2:  what is crackers then ?  Speaker1:  there is another group of people who loudly call themselves hackers , but they aren ' t . they break into computers and break the phone system . real hackers call these people crackers , and want nothing to do with them . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  so they are two totally different concepts .  Speaker1:  well , the real hackers mostly think crackers are lazy , irresponsible and not very bright , and feel that being able to break security does make you a hacker any more than being able to start cars without keys makes you an automotive engineer . unfortunately , many journalists and writers have been fooled into using the word hacker to describe crackers . this irritates real hackers to no end .  Speaker2:  i see . then the basic different is , hackers build things , crackers break them . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  you got it .

Speaker1:  why ? i think cats are ok . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  i can ’ t bear being near cats . they don ’ t seem to like me either .  Speaker1:  i like wild animals . i don ’ t like spiders and snakes . i think spiders and snakes are disgusting .  Speaker2:  i ’ m fond of snakes . i think they ’ re great . i agree with you about spiders though . i think spiders are horrible . i think it ’ s because they have so many legs .

 | 
Speaker1: would you like to go to work or continue your studies after graduation ?  Speaker2:  i think i will continue my studies . now it ' s not easy for a graduate with bachelor ' s degree to get a job since there are so many graduates with master ' s or doctor ' s degree . we are likely to lose in competing with them in the job market .  Speaker1:  so you will continue to study for a master ' s degree ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  well , i think so . but i am thinking of going aboard to get a master ' s and doctor ' s degree . if can get a ph . d . abroad , it will be much easy for me to get a job at home .

Speaker1:  even though the traffic is bumper - to - bumper out there , i don ' t think it ' s heavy traffic that makes bill late . he takes the train , remember ?  Speaker2:  oh , that ' s right . well , the train shouldn ' t be late . that means there is only one explanation . . . bill must have overslept .  Speaker1:  well , to be fare , since he ' s coming all the way from lancaster , he ' s got to get up much earlier than the rest of us . he must get start on his commute about six thirty , no telling what time he actually gets up .  Speaker2:  that ' s right , because he ' s got to get to the train station from his house , then take the blue line into the city , then switch trains to the red line . in all , the trip ' s got to take more than 2 hours . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  why doesn ' t he just drive to work ?

Speaker1:  don ' t jump to conclusions . look at the bright side , try to make another date again .

Speaker1:  it ' s facial paper , and it fits into the rings of my binder ! it ' s magical .
 | 
Speaker1: nice day , isn ' t it ?
 | 
Speaker1: cheers ! to our first night in our new apartment . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  it ' s so quiet . i ' m not really used to it .  Speaker1:  all you hear is the crickets and the breeze .  Speaker2:  it ' s a little eerie . i ' m sure the silence will begin to grow on me . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  well , i think it ' s fabulous . and the neighbors don ' t even seem to exist .
 | 
Speaker1: your knowledge of english is really surprising . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  oh , it ' s nothing to speak of .  Speaker1:  no , seriously . i am impressed .  Speaker2:  thank you . i appreciate the compliment .  Speaker1:  your knowledge of english is really surprising . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  oh , it ' s nothing to speak of .

Speaker1: mom . my legs are killing me .
 | 
Speaker1: how ’ s your trip going ?  Speaker2:  oh i ’ m enjoying myself but it ’ s so hot here _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  isn ’ t london hot in the summer ?  Speaker2:  well it can be but shanghai is much warmer than london .  Speaker1:  i see . what about transport ? how does shanghai compare to london ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  actually i think the buses and trains here are more modern .  Speaker1:  and what about the number of people on the streets ?
 | 
Speaker1: are you going to tell me about the stamp , or not ?

 | 
Speaker1: there are so many environment problems in the world today . do you think we can really solve them all or will destroy the world ?  Speaker2:  i hope that world leaders can get together and agree on a plan for action , but i doubt it ’ ll happen before it ’ s too late . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  we need to solve the problem of air pollution before we destroy the atmosphere . there ’ s lots of clean , modern technology , but companies in developed countries say it ’ s expensive . developing countries put more emphasis on economic development than on environment protection .  Speaker2:  everyone is looking at the issue in the short term , rather than the long term . it ’ s the same with the destruction of the rainforests . countries and companies just want the wood . they ’ re not thinking about the long - term damage to the forests . we should also remember that the forests are an important natural habitat for thousands of species of animal and plant life . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  in other parts of the world , especially in africa , there is a problem with desertification . climate change and over - farming are causing farmland to turn into desert . in means that people cannot grow enough food .  Speaker2:  it also means that people sometimes fight over the famp 3land that remains . damaging the environment actually leads to conflict between people . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  have you ever thought about joining an organization committed to protecting the environment ? you could get involved with projects to improve the environment .

Speaker1: it ' s almost midnight ! we are about to start a brand new year !  Speaker2:  i know it ' s so exciting ! a new year is always like a clean slate . fresh start to accomplish any dreams , objectives and goals .  Speaker1:  do you have a new year ' s resolution ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  i was thinking about it , but i ' m never able to keep my new year ' s resolution . last year for example i joined a gym and only went twice .  Speaker1:  yeah i know what you mean . that ' s why this year i am keeping things more simple . maybe like getting together with friends i haven ' t seen in a long time , or doing some volunteering work .  Speaker2:  that seems reasonable . we should get together and watch the ball drop in times square . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  sure , as long as you don ' t try to kiss me at midnight !

Speaker2:  maybe it ’ s just that he is stressed out from work or something . he does have a pretty nerve wracking job you know .  Speaker1:  yeah but , he is always in a really foul mood . i try to find out what ’ s bothering him or get him to talk about his day but , he always shuts down and brushes me off .  Speaker2:  men are like that you know . they can feel nervous , anxious or on edge and the only way they can express it is by trying to hide it through aggressiveness . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  i guess you are right . what do you think i should do ? he wasn ’ t always this grouchy you know . . .
 | 
Speaker1: sorry . what was that you said ?  Speaker2:  i ' ll meet you at the gate round about seven .  Speaker1:  where ?  Speaker2:  at the gate .  Speaker1:  when , did you say ?

Speaker2:  he ’ s huge ! he must go to the gym to have a well - built body like that . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  do you prefer tall girls or short ones ?  Speaker2:  i don ’ t mind , but i like girls with long hair .  Speaker1:  we have different tastes . i like girls with short hair . i like tall girls - probably because i ’ m so tall myself . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  have you ever dated a girl taller than you ?  Speaker1:  no , never . i don ’ t think i ’ ve ever met a girl taller than me ! have you gained weight recently ?

Speaker2:  no , by that time , i was sick of sightseeing . i had had enough of art galleries , cathedrals , fountains , statues , and palaces !  Speaker1:  so what did you do ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  we spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . we had a few coffees , watched a movie , and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel .  Speaker1:  my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . did you go to the louvre ?
 | 
Speaker1: how was the party last night ? did you enjoy it ?  Speaker2:  oh , don ’ t talk to me about last night ! it was the most awful evening i ’ ve ever had . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  why ? what happened ?  Speaker2:  well . mary had promised to be my date , but she stood me up . i waited for her for a full hour in the cold wind .  Speaker1:  what about the party ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  it was boring . the music was too slow and the food was lousy and , above all , i was really sick of the same old crowd all the time .  Speaker1:  so how long did you stay ?
 | 
Speaker1: harry is so down that he won ' t talk to anyone . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  i know only too well what that ' s like .  Speaker1:  what do you mean ?
 |

Speaker2:  so what are you going to do ? take up an art class or something ? _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  well , first of all , i ’ ve decided to stop smoking . it ’ s not that i ’ m pinching pennies or anything , it ’ s just that i ’ ve been smoking since i was sixteen , and i think it ’ s time to stop .

Speaker1:  maybe her uncle will . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  i think so . the wedding will be held at her church , right ?  Speaker1:  right . red rochester will officiate at the wedding .
 | 
Speaker1: how do you think the transport system in our city could be improved ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  i think that the public transport system could be made simpler . i never know where the bus routes actually go . the routes seem to twist and turn rather than going roughly in a straight line .  Speaker1:  i think we just need to build more roads . then there would be more space for cars to drive and we ’ d have fewer traffic jams .  Speaker2:  if we built more roads , people would just fill them with cars again . i think we should discourage people from using their cars . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  how would you do that ?  Speaker2:  i think we should do a few things at once . improving public transport would encourage people to use that . if we also charge people to use their cars in the city centre , they won ’ t use their cars as much . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  i don ’ t know . i think it ’ s unfair to make drivers pay more money . they already pay a lot of tax - petrol tax , for example .  Speaker2:  i think that they should pay more tax . look at the damage they cause to the environment and people ’ s health by discharging all those exhaust fumes . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  the air would certainly be cleaner if there were fewer cars being used in the city . the problem is that people will see it as reducing their freedom . it well be unpopular .

 | 
Speaker1: when it comes to select a fund , you will always read “ past performance is not an indication of future results ” , can you believe that ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  maybe it is right since everything is possible . you know the market changes quickly these days . but i still have doubted those funds with bad stock performance . for me , his stock record is the very important criteria to decide which to buy . i really want to decrease the risk reach the minimum and achieve the maximum returns .  Speaker1:  but i still have doubted those funds with bad stock performance . for me , his stock record is the very important criteria to decide which to buy . i really want to decrease the risk reach the minimum and achieve the maximum returns .

Speaker1:  that ' s right . and it ' s a b that i ' ll be writing too . her name is olga .  Speaker2:  maybe olga can introduce you to some of her friends who can write to you in german and you can do the same for her with your friends to write her in english .

Speaker1: it ' s awfully quiet around here .  Speaker2:  yeah . there ' s nobody in sight . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  i have a feeling that we ' re not supposed to be in here .

Speaker2:  um . . . actually i am guessing you didn ' t get the memo . your boss was selected to fill the vacancy in the ceo slot . he actually is the ceo now , or will be , as soon as the official press releases and hoopla is done with .  Speaker1:  yikes ! you are joking , right ? i can ' t believe it . no wonder he is so stressed and bossy lately . i thought he was just being ostentatious by giving orders to people and all the different departments . what big shoes to fill ! _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  no kidding ! when the last ceo left , we were worried about the future of the company .  Speaker1:  what does a ceo do anyway ? i know the ceo makes the most money in the company , but what does he actually do ?

Speaker1: there is a tornado warning on . my mother just told me she heard it on the radio .  Speaker2:  what is a tornado warning ?  Speaker1:  it means that a tornado has been seen somewhere in the area . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  really ? in new berlin ?  Speaker1:  no . not necessarily in town . but in southern wisconsin somewhere . a tornado has been spotted . they have two stages here . this is what is called a tornado watch . that means that the weather conditions are perfect for a tornado . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  i understand . they think a tornado might come .  Speaker1:  yes . people should look out , because maybe there will be tornadoes coming . so it ' s called a watch .  Speaker2:  and the second stage is called a tornado warning .  Speaker1:  yes . if a tornado has been spotted , they announce a tornado warning . so if there ' s a tornado warning on , it means a tornado is out there somewhere . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  it ' s scary .  Speaker1:  well . tornadoes can be dangerous , it ' s true . if we hear something like a loud train coming , then we have to go in the basement .  Speaker2:  what do you mean a loud train ?  Speaker1:  that is what tornadoes sound like . they sound like trains . they ' re very loud . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  but if you hear them coming , isn ' t it already too late ?  Speaker1:  maybe . it depends on the tornado . some can move across the ground at 200 miles an hour . that is very fast . others aren ' t so fast . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  have you seen a lot of them ?  Speaker1:  i ' ve only seen one in my life . i was looking out the window . it was around two miles away . it was very interesting to watch . but it was heading toward my friend ' s house . so i quickly called them on the phone .  Speaker2:  did it hit their house ?  Speaker1:  no , it didn ' t . but they are glad i called them .  Speaker2:  what were they doing when you called ? _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  they were all sitting in the living room watching tv . they had no idea a tornado was coming toward their house . if it had hit them , they could have all been killed .

Speaker2:  well , we can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  what else can we do to protect the environment ?

Speaker2:  it must have been a few years ago now . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  i thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis .  Speaker2:  they do . once my son was born , there was no reason to drive this car anymore . it ' s only a two - seater , you know ! _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  what else is wrong with it ?  Speaker2:  the heating controls don ' t work anymore , so it always feels like it ' s about 100 degrees in the car — even in the summer ! _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  anything else ?  Speaker2:  the brakes don ' t really work that well anymore either . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  why don ' t you get it all fixed ?

Speaker1:  it is not your mother finding one for you ?  Speaker2:  i will find one myself , of course . i ’ m a modern girl .  Speaker1:  perhaps you can try the three minutes date , the latest type . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  you mean dozens of the opposite sex meet each other for three minutes in a dimly bar serving alcohol , i hate that idea .  Speaker1:  no , there is an updated virgin , three minutes video date . i know an online dating website providing such service with a microphone and webcam , you can sigh for it . you can be face - to - face with a guy talking for maximum three minutes .  Speaker2:  i don ’ t think it makes sense . three minutes is such a short time .  Speaker1:  i think you can find out if there is a possibility of romance within the first second of meeting someone , so - called love at first sight . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  anyway , i don ’ t want to post my face up for sale on the internet like that .  Speaker1:  don ’ t worry . there are many other options using the internet as dating methods . some sites operate at international standard even have got certifications . of course , for these sites , you have to pay a membership fee . but all in all , it is more serious and professional . the chance of meeting a good and serious person who does not play games is higher .

Speaker2:  why on earth would she do that ? you mean that she intentionally did not eat any food for days ? that ' s crazy !  Speaker1:  yeah , but that ' s what she did .  Speaker2:  i can ' t believe that there are girls who are willing to do that to their bodies . and all for a certain look .  Speaker1:  well , it ' s not just the girl ’ s fault . it ' s also society ' s fault - magazines and ads that show - thin models all saying , it ' s in to be thin . it ' s hard for them not to listen .

Speaker2:  what did you do ? _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  i didn ' t do anything . finally , he left . but then i saw him again today . outside the shoe store . near the cafe . i went into a cd store and pretended i was looking at cd ' s . but then he came in too .  Speaker2:  did he leave when you left ? _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  yes . then i noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . he was following me .  Speaker2:  what did you do ? _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  he followed me all the way home !  Speaker2:  that ' s about five blocks . and around corners too . so he was definitely following you . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  yes , he was . i ' m not imagining it . finally , just when i got home , i turned around and looked at him . he was just standing there . he didn ' t smile . he just stood there . it was so obvious . what should i do ? i ' m so scared . can i call the police ?  Speaker2:  actually , i don ' t think you can call the police . not yet at least . he hasn ' t done anything . and probably the police will just ignore it . but if anything happens again , then maybe you should call .  Speaker1:  why can ' t i call the police now ? he was definitely following me !  Speaker2:  of course you can call the police if you want . that ' s not what i mean . i ' m just saying that they probably won ' t do anything . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  i suppose . what can they do ? i don ' t even know who he is .

Speaker1:  i ' ve got the correct change already . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  first you put your money in the dollar slot or the coin slot . the dollars have to be smooth .  Speaker1:  ok , what next ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  just know that sometimes the money doesn ' t go in perfectly the first time and you have to try again .  Speaker1:  ok , next ?  Speaker2:  choose what you want and push the button . sometimes it takes a couple of tries . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  i agree with you .

Speaker1:  oh yes . men , women , and children shake hands all the time .  Speaker2:  it ’ s very simple . men shake hands , women and children don ’ t .  Speaker1:  but some women do shake hands . and now a lot of children have such good manners , they shake hands too . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  well , a good rule to follow is , for men you hold out your hand , for women and children , you wait and see what they do .  Speaker1:  that sounds easy enough .

Speaker1: that ’ s really a let - down .  Speaker2:  yeah . he really does let me down . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  but that should not be the reason for you to lose heart .

Speaker2:  i ’ m looking forward to seeing westminster abbey , where many historical figures are buried , like isaac newton , the great mathematician and winston churchill , the great wartime leader .  Speaker1:  nearby , on the banks of the thames , there ’ s the statue of boadicea . she fought the romans when they invaded britain .  Speaker2:  women have often played an important role in british history . queen elizabeth i built a navy strong enough to fight off the spanish armada in 1588 . more recently , margaret thatcher transformed british society in the 1980 ’ s .  Speaker1:  she was a very controversial leader . are we going to visit the famous tower of london later ?  Speaker2:  there ’ s a lot to see there . perhaps we should go tomorrow .  Speaker1:  i ’ m looking forward to seeing the famous castle and prison . many historic figures were imprisoned there in the past . i really want to see the crown jewels too .  Speaker2:  i ’ ve seen them before . they ’ re quite incredible . if you want to see historical figures in london , there ’ s one place you have to go . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  where ’ s that ? oh , i know ! madame tussaud ’ s the waxworks museum .

Speaker1: i do feel like a trip to florida on such a gloomy day in new york , to enjoy the sunshine while lying on the beaches of florida .  Speaker2:  that ' s a great idea . it ' s the best season for tourists in florida . you can also get a good sun - tan there . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  but if the sunshine is too strong , it might damage the eyes and the skin .  Speaker2:  you can put on your shades . and remember don ' t make your skin look like a tomato . or else after that your skin will begin to flake off . you may even wind up with skin cancer .  Speaker1:  i see . overdoing it will do more harm than good .

 | 
Speaker1: what are you reading ?  Speaker2:  it ’ s an article about language . it talks about the idea of having a single global language . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  it seems that english already is the main global language . does the article suggest that there should be an artificial language like esperanto as the world language .  Speaker2:  actually , it suggest english . the main argument is that english is already being studied as a second language in most countries - china , india , mexico , nigeria , pakistan , and japan . so beginning again with a language like esperanto would be wasteful . the second argument is that english is used in modern technology far more that any other language . most emails are sent in english and the vast majority of website use english .  Speaker1:  does the article say anything about other language ? how will they survive in an english - speaking world ?  Speaker2:  the article points out that many languages have been lost and will be lost , but others will continue to be used for generation , even if english continues to be the dominant language . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  right . all the people who speak chinese . hindi , french and spanish aren ’ t suddenly going to stop using those languages .

Speaker2:  well , here we go again . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  what happened ? why did everyone get so quiet ?

Speaker2:  nah , it ' s a place where homelesspeople go to eat . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  how did you get involved in something like that ?  Speaker2:  well , the minister at my church told us about it , and it seemed interesting . i thought i ' d try it once , and if i didn ' t like it i ' d stop .  Speaker1:  so what do you do there ?

Speaker1:  what are you talking about ? let me see that . . . what are horoscopes ?

Speaker1:  january 5th .  Speaker2:  let ’ s see . . . you ’ re a capricorn . it says that you will be feeling stress at work , but you could see new , exciting developments in your love life . looks like we ’ ll both have interesting summers !  Speaker1:  that ’ s bogus . i don ' t feel any stress at work , and my love life is practically nonexistent . this zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense .  Speaker2:  no , it ’ s not , your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality . see ? it says that an aries is energetic and loves to socialize .  Speaker1:  well , you certainly match those criteria , but they ’ re so broad they could apply to anyone . what does it say about me ?
 | 
Speaker1: you must like negotiating a lot . people are saying , you are a super negotiator .  Speaker2:  ha , i am flattered . actually , when it comes to negotiate , you don ’ t need to like it . you just need to understand how it works .  Speaker1:  i am not good at it by any means . give me some advice . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  well , generally speaking , if you want to change someone ’ s mind or understand his position , you have to put yourself in his shoes . understand his need and the cost for his need . and then you work together to find a solution .  Speaker1:  sounds easy . but how can i apply to practice ? i am thinking about applying for more reimbursement for my mobile bill . but i am afraid our boss will turn me down .

Speaker1: are you looking forward to seeing that big concert next week ?

Speaker1:  well , the north of norway is almost always cold , but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it ’ s a wet country , so there ’ s snow almost everywhere in winter .

Speaker2:  what ? you feel sorry for the butterflies ? _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  yes . i think they should just let them fly free , and not try to sell them to foreigners . it is a kind of destruction of nature .  Speaker2:  well , i agree with you . i ' d rather think that the butterflies are flying around in the mountains . i just wonder if they really catch so many that it affects the butterfly population .  Speaker1:  who knows ? hey , i like these jade bears here . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  how much are they ?  Speaker1:  this one is 2300 dollars . maybe i should buy it for my mother . what do you think ?  Speaker2:  if you want . didn ' t you buy her a small vase already ?

Speaker1:  sure , but how ?  Speaker2:  you can ask her out for drinks after work . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  but for what reasons ? she doesn ' t even know who i am .  Speaker2:  then you ' ve got a lot of work to do . you need to get her to notice you first . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  easier said than done .  Speaker2:  you can start by meeting her at the bus stop and saying ' hello ' to her . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  but i always get tongue - tied when i see her .  Speaker2:  that ' s something you need to overcome . men should make the first move as most girls prefer being chased . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  i see . i ' ll try .

Speaker2:  that ' s annoying , but nothing to worry about .

Speaker1:  he must be all over you the first time he saw you .  Speaker2:  he said that i put all other girls in the shade . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  that means he was head over heels in love with you .

Speaker1: i think that show biz stars have a really easy life . they have lots of money , so they can buy almost anything they want . they ’ re famous , so everyone loves them . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . they must get sick of it .  Speaker1:  i bet they love it really . sure , they complain about it , but that just gets them more publicity , doesn ’ t it ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . they only want it for their films .  Speaker1:  no way ! they want publicity for themselves , so that they get invited to make more films , go to lots of cocktail parties , and even make albums ! they have such an easy life . they don ’ t even pay for drinks when they go to a cocktail party . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  show biz stars have plenty of expenses . that ’ s why they need so much money . they need million of dollars to buy big , seclude houses and wonderful dresses . i bet most show biz stars would prefer to wear jeans and a t - shirt , but they can ’ t because their managers force them to wear clothes they don ’ t like .  Speaker1:  i don ’ t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . they ’ re overpaid , over - ambitious , and over - adored .

Speaker1:  rivers have created deep valleys and canyons like the grand canyon .

Speaker1: did you hear ? the state is thinking of legalizing gambling in our city ! soon we are gonna have amazing hotels and casinos here which will be good for our business !  Speaker2:  are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the intentional exploitation of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! it disgusts me .  Speaker1:  what are you talking about ? how does it exploit people ?  Speaker2:  well , to begin with , gambling is addictive , ruins marriages , destroys families and bankrupts communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses , cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . secondly , it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . women gamble to escape , and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction . underage gamblers often start gambling on sports with friends and then illegal bookies .  Speaker1:  geez ! now that i think about it , maybe legalizing gambling isn ’ t such a good idea ! although , i have been to las vegas , and i didn ’ t become addicted or anything like that .

Speaker1:  so chinese people prefer soccer or basketball ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  yes , i think so . but to be perfectly honest , i ' m not really a sports nut . when i was in high school i played on the school volleyball team . are you a diehard football fan ?  Speaker1:  oh , certainly . i wouldn ' t miss a game for the world . my girlfriend says i have an addiction . and actually , if i had to choose between her and my games . . . i ' d probably pick football .

Speaker2:  i know , but i was so upset . i mean , come on ! does she have to do everything her boyfriend says ?  Speaker1:  you know she probably feels just as bad . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  well , i think i was being a little selfish myself . i know they don ' t get to see each other very often .  Speaker1:  well , in that case i guess maybe you can be more understanding . you shouldn ' t let a trivial thing like this stand in the way of your friendship . after all you can go to the beach anytime you want .

Speaker1:  i think the olympics help to promote world peace . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  i ’ m not sure about that . we still have many wars in the world . i think that the idea behind the olympics is a good one , but the reality is that during the olympics countries compete . there ’ s no real spirit of cooperation and people are usually not very friendly to each other .  Speaker1:  you are so pessimistic ! the olympics is a great opportunity for athletes to demonstrate their speed , skill , agility and strength . most people hope to see someone from their country win , but i think that they are just happy to see good performances by any athlete .

Speaker1: which social problem do you think the government needs to concentrate on most ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  i think housing is a big problem . there are thousands of homeless people on the streets .  Speaker1:  how would you solve the problem ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  i have a good idea to solve it . the government could provide some money for homeless people to build their own homes .  Speaker1:  it would probably be very expensive . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  i think the government can afford it . besides , there are many advantages . homeless people would find it easier to get jobs if they had an address . they would learn some useful skill for finding jobs i  Speaker1:  it ’ s not a bad idea . i think education is the biggest problem at the moment . schools don ’ t seem to have enough money to educate kids properly . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  if we are to invest more money to education , we will need to raise taxes . that wouldn ’ t be popular with voters .  Speaker1:  most voters what everything both ways . they want the government to pay for lots of things , but without increasing taxes .

Speaker1:  why ? you make me confused . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  he lives nearby and he would just glance at the newspaper headlines , read the political sections and return them later .  Speaker1:  why does he have such a privilege ?  Speaker2:  he used to be a hero during the war time and everyone respect him .  Speaker1:  i see . does he live by himself ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  yes , he has no children and his wife passed away when he was in the battle .  Speaker1:  he must be lonely ?

Speaker1: han maimed , what ' s your plan for the weekend ?  Speaker2:  i plan to travel around harvard university and know more about it . to tell you the truth , i plan to apply for harvard after graduation from high school . it ’ s better to get to know it . what about you ? _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  i get together with my christian brothers on saturdays .  Speaker2:  oh , my god ! john , i didn ’ t know you are religious . you just look like a scientific kook , like leonard in the big bang theory . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  come on , han maimed , don ’ t make a fuss . a lot of americans , including many scientists , believe in religion .  Speaker2:  but i ’ m really surprised . i thought science and religion are not compatible , are they ?  Speaker1:  yes , they are compatible . actually , the u . s . is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world .  Speaker2:  i ' ve heard about it a little bit before , but i don ’ t understand . how can people believe in god since they know god doesn ' t exist ?  Speaker1:  that ’ s a little complicated . you ’ ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the u . s . history later on . religion was and is a part of american people ’ s life . guess what ? even harvard university , which is a highly academic institution , is in a sense the product of religion . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  really ?  Speaker1:  absolutely ! it was founded by a group of puritan immigrants from england .  Speaker2:  why was it founded by the puritans ? where were the atheistic educators ? _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  because most of the first english immigrants who came to the united states were puritans .  Speaker2:  how come ? i mean why most of them were religious people ?  Speaker1:  that ’ s because in the 16th and 17th century , there was a series of religious reforms in england . many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries .  Speaker2:  so , you mean people didn ' t enjoy religious freedom in england ? _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  yes , that ' s why puritans moved to the new world , where they believed they could establish a heaven for puritans . later on , it was these puritans who founded harvard college .  Speaker2:  why did they want to found a college ?  Speaker1:  many puritans had received classic style of higher education in oxford university and cambridge university back in england . they hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  oh , i see .  Speaker1:  actually harvard was first named ' new college ' , without a formal name .  Speaker2:  when did it begin to be called harvard university ?  Speaker1:  in 1639 , it was renamed after its major benefactor john harvard . interestingly , johnharvard himself was a clergyman . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  it seems that harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion .  Speaker1:  therefore , it ’ s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion , there would note harvard .  Speaker2:  wow , i didn ’ t know that religion had played such an important role in harvard history .  Speaker1:  religion has been playing an indispensible part in harvard history as well as the u . s . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  i finally begin to get to know harvard . it seems that my knowledge of harvard is rather poor . i have a lot work to do before applying for harvard .  Speaker1:  remember that harvard is a part of the united states . so you have to know the u . s . history and culture if you want to have in - depth knowledge of harvard . the two are closely related .

Speaker2:  he can spend more time with his grandchildren . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  oh , i don ’ t think he wants to . he wants to travel to several different countries around the world .  Speaker2:  so , he wants to have a more active retirement . good idea ! _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  how do you want to spend your old age ?

Speaker1: would you like to come over for dinner tonight ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  sure , but i have to tell you that i ' ve become a vegetarian . i don ' t eat any kind of meat .  Speaker1:  when did you decide to become a vegetarian ?  Speaker2:  i saw a program a few months ago about how animals are raised for human consumption . i haven ' t been able to eat a single piece of meat since . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  that ' s great . do you find that you eat a lot more fruit and vegetables now ?  Speaker2:  definitely . i ' ve also been buying organic fruit and vegetables , which is more expensive , but much better for you because they don ' t have any pesticides on them . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  you ' ve really turned into a health nut , haven ' t you ?  Speaker2:  i guess you could say that . eating fruit and vegetables helps keep you healthy . i ' ve lost 5 pounds and i feel great ! _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  how do you get enough protein in your diet ?  Speaker2:  well , i eat a lot more tofu , beans , nuts and some fish . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  well , don ' t worry about dinner . i ' ll only make vegetarian dishes for you . do you like sushi ?  Speaker2:  i prefer cooked fish to raw fish , but if you really like it , make it .  Speaker1:  how about a spicy tofu and vegetable stir - fry ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  that sounds great . what time should i come over ?

 | 
Speaker1: what do you think is harder , reading or writing ?  Speaker2:  well , they ’ re completely different . reading is passive , and writing is active .  Speaker1:  i don ’ t think i understand what you mean . could you explain a little more ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  in reading you need to recognize language by seeing the words on the page and knowing what they are . in writing you have to produce language , you have to create your own words on a blank page .  Speaker1:  oh , now i see what you mean . when you ’ re reading , you are just looking , but when you are writing , you are actually doing something !  Speaker2:  a reading knowledge of a language is larger and different from a writing knowledge . don ’ t you think so ?  Speaker1:  i think i see what you mean . i can read shakespeare but i definitely can ’ t write it . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  exactly .  Speaker1:  so i have another question for you . what do you think is harder , speaking or understanding ?  Speaker2:  they ’ re both harder than reading or writing .  Speaker1:  in what way ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  because they are direct communication with another person , and there ’ s a time limit . this time limit is the most serious problem for foreigners , even for those who know lots of english .  Speaker1:  you are making me feel really discouraged .
 | 
Speaker1: hello !  Speaker2:  oh , hi !

 | 
Speaker1: i am kind of nervous .  Speaker2:  nervous ? why ?  Speaker1:  i don ' t know . i never went to a church before . i was not raised as a christian , so i don ' t know what to do . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  don ' t worry . you don ' t have to do anything . all you have to do is listen . you will enjoy it .  Speaker1:  maybe . i know i agreed to go with you , but now i don ' t feel right about it .  Speaker2:  listen , ryan . catholics welcome people who aren ' t catholics to visit the church . you don ' t have to pretend to be catholic . it ' s okay if you just come to listen . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  really ?  Speaker2:  yes . we are kind and welcoming people . it is not a secret society or something like that . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  alright . but will we sing ?  Speaker2:  yes , but you don ' t even have to sing . if you want to sing along , you can .  Speaker1:  i don ' t know the words .  Speaker2:  there is a songbook . all the words are in the songbook . many people have to read the words . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  and will i go up to the front to have the bread and wine ?  Speaker2:  no . that is something only true catholics do . so if you come to the church as a visitor , you only listen to the service . but you shouldn ' t go up to the altar for the bread and wine . only after someone joins the church , then they go up for the eucharist .  Speaker1:  eu - char - ist ? what is that ?  Speaker2:  that is the special word for the ritual of the bread and wine . the catholics call it the eucharist . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  it doesn ' t sound like an english word .  Speaker2:  it ' s not . it ' s an ancient greek word . it means gratitude .  Speaker1:  alright . well , i feel more comfortable now . now i understand i am welcome as a visitor .

Speaker2:  used to . but now he is too old to play in a fierce game like this . but kobe is the upcoming superstar now .  Speaker1:  kobe is a good player but i heard he is a womanizer .  Speaker2:  that is not true . they are just jealous of him !  Speaker1:  jordan is a legend , anyway . an idol that no one can replace . i think clive can make a good professional basketball player . he is not just about muscles he also plays smart .  Speaker2:  you know what , he is also an outstanding football player . he is surely to be a star of tomorrow .  Speaker1:  by the way , do you know if he has a girl friend ?

Speaker2:  he was arrested by the police for drinking and driving .  Speaker1:  was it his first offence ?  Speaker2:  unfortunately not . he was charged with a dui when he was in university .  Speaker1:  what happened to him then ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  not much ; it was a minor offence back then . he got away with a fine of $ 500 .  Speaker1:  did they take his license away ?  Speaker2:  no , they were really easy on him . the problem is that that was a long time ago . they are much tougher on crime now . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  what do you think will happen to him ?  Speaker2:  well , he ' ll definitely lose his license , pay a fine , and maybe even spend some time in jail .  Speaker1:  that doesn ' t sound too promising . does he have a defence lawyer ?

Speaker1: why are you in such a good mood today ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  well , yesterday , i decided to face my fear of heights .  Speaker1:  i didn ' t know you were scared of heights ! was it really bad ?  Speaker2:  let me put it this way . i ' ve never seen a professional sorts game in a stadium because i could never get myself to walk to the top of the stairs to sit down . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  so what did you do about it yesterday ?  Speaker2:  i went sky - diving ! _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  you ' re kidding me ! that sounds really scary !  Speaker2:  it was scary , but it felt great , too . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  weren ' t you scared ?  Speaker2:  of course i was scared . but i had an instructor that went with me and that helped .  Speaker1:  so have you cured your fear of heights ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  i think so . after i jumped out of the plane , i realized that i should just enjoy life . worrying about it or not doing things out of fear is just plain silly .  Speaker1:  i ' m impressed . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  are you scared of anything ?  Speaker1:  well , sometimes i get scared when i ' m in my apartment all by myself . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  what do you think is going to happen ?  Speaker1:  i always worry that the door is unlocked or that a window is open and that a stranger will come in and steal my things .
 | 
Speaker1: what do you do when you are angry ?  Speaker2:  i usually calm down first and think about the reason that caused my anger . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  that ’ s smart . what do you usually do to relieve your anger ?  Speaker2:  something like listening to music is a good idea .  Speaker1:  oh , what kind of music do you listen to ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  classic . something that could calm your mind .  Speaker1:  i think that might work for me as well .  Speaker2:  working out is another good way to relieve anger . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  like what ?
 | 
Speaker1: i feel pity for the old man .  Speaker2:  i feel the same way . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  it must be dreadful to grow old .

Speaker1: do you know that scientists replicated a sheep into an identical clone . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  i heard about that . it was successful .  Speaker1:  it ' s a big jump in science . maybe more like a leap .
 | 
Speaker1: so it looks like we start selling in the u . s . next year .  Speaker2:  did mr . lin put you in charge of marketing ? _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  he ' s still not sure whether he wants to put me in charge , or whether he wants to hire an american . but even if he hires an american , i ' ll probably be transferred to our american office .  Speaker2:  where will it be ?  Speaker1:  we aren ' t sure yet . maybe l . a . i think l . a . would be the best idea .  Speaker2:  is it because of trade negotiations that we can start selling in the u . s . ? _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  yes , the recent agreements between the two governments have changed everything . now we have the right to sell in america at a much lower tariff . it ' s going to be good . we can compete more directly with them .  Speaker2:  great . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  our computers have a high level of quality now . we can demonstrate it . and our prices will be good . so i think it will really be worthwhile .  Speaker2:  you seem excited about it . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  well , you know i studied marketing in america . so maybe the thought of going back there to promote our brand is kind of exciting to me . i ' d love to be part of the team .  Speaker2:  do you honestly think we can compete though ? all the computer giants are there .  Speaker1:  yes , i do . i think we can compete . i think we can make a name for ourselves . it will be hard at first . but if we develop a good advertising campaign , i think we can break into the market . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  the company will have to choose a good advertising firm . and then there ' s the problem of quality . how do we convince american buyers that our quality is good ?  Speaker1:  it takes some time . because even if the quality is high , people won ' t accept a high tech product unless they recognize the name . name recognition is crucial . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  well , i hope it all works out , john . i think if you ' re part of the team , things will go well . but you know we ' d all miss you here . so i won ' t say i ' m happy to think that you ' re leaving .  Speaker1:  that ' s very nice of you to say . but if we set up an office there in the states , maybe you could try to become part of it .

Speaker1: what do you plan to do for your birthday ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  i want to have a picnic with my friends , mum .  Speaker1:  how about a party at home ? that way we can get together and celebrate it .

Speaker2:  yes . i am going to take some university courses there . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  sounds hard .  Speaker2:  yes , but i think it ' s probably for the best .  Speaker1:  won ’ t you get lonely ?

Speaker1:  how was your summer vacation ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  i worked over the summer at a restaurant . have to make tuition money , right ? what did you do ?  Speaker1:  i took summer school . i withdrew from two of my classes last year so i wanted to make them up . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  so are you officially a junior now ?  Speaker1:  yeah . and i have 5 credits to spare . i only needed to take 10 credits over the summer , but i took 15 because the price was the same . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  that makes sense . so where is nicole ?  Speaker1:  she dropped out of school completely .  Speaker2:  really ? why ? _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  she worked at a startup company as an intern and since the business did well , they asked her if she wanted to work full time .  Speaker2:  wow . she ' s so lucky . she doesn ' t have a degree and she already has a job . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  it sounds good now , but i ' m traditional . i want the degree , so i wouldn ' t have accepted the offer .

Speaker1:  i met with the supervisor just this morning . i don ' t know , but i am a little worried . who do you think will get sacked ?  Speaker2:  i ' m not sure . . . well , first , it couldn ' t be george . he is such a kiss - ass . he ' d wash the boss ' s dog if he asked .  Speaker1:  no , it ' s not going to be george . i don ' t think it ' s andy either . he is involved with the boss ' s sister in - law . and you know how whipped our boss is .  Speaker2:  that ' s true . what about lisa ? i bet there ' s nobody who could do a worse job than her .  Speaker1:  lisa ? no way . i ' ve heard a rumor that she and the boss were having an affair . you know rumors can ' t come out from nowhere .  Speaker2:  well , okay . then there is still michael . but he ' s pet after having the best sales record for three months in a row . it definitely won ' t be michael .  Speaker1:  no , that would be crazy . but then who will it be ? oh dear , it must be me . i should have known it ! why else would he have talked to me alone about the downsizing . what should i do ? i ' ve got a family t

Speaker1: do you speak only english in the class , or does your teacher explain everything to you in spanish ?  Speaker2:  oh , we never speak spanish in class ! miss . parker speaks to us only in english . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  i suppose she ' s right . does she speak english very slowly ?  Speaker2:  not always . sometimes we don ' t understand her . then she has to repeat what she said .  Speaker1:  it must be interesting to study english . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  mario and i are the best students in the class . miss . parker says that my pronunciation is very good .  Speaker1:  is english pronunciation easy or difficult ?

Speaker2:  you mean visit a factory ?  Speaker1:  yes . i heard there ' s a lager motor company nearby which open to the public every weekend . we can go to see how a car is manufactured and learn more about the automobile industry .  Speaker2:  good idea ! i ' ve always been interested in that . how much is the entrance fee ?  Speaker1:  i ' m not sure , but as far as i know , most factory tours are free . they are sponsored by the company providing the tour .  Speaker2:  really ? what do the companies do that for ?  Speaker1:  i believe most of them think of it as good public relations . they can promote their product and make their company better - known .  Speaker2:  oh , i see . so factory tours are good for companies as well as visitors .  Speaker1:  exactly .

Speaker1:  so , why did you apply for such a demanding job ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  well , the government offers its employees excellent health insurance benefits .  Speaker1:  oh , i see . and can your family utilize 5 the health insurance , too ?  Speaker2:  yeah , that ’ s the best part . all of my children can get free medical care .  Speaker1:  that ’ s a great employment benefit !

Speaker1:  for crying out loud . . . how fast are we losing money ?  Speaker2:  um . . . how can i put this ? let ’ s just say that at this pace , we will be filing for chapter eleven in less than three months . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  what ! geez ! how could this have happened ? so what ’ s the bad news ?

Speaker2:  yeah , yeah , but today ’ s lesson was all about the creation of the universe .  Speaker1:  a physics class about the creation of the universe ? that ’ s some pretty unscientific language there . sounds more religious to me .  Speaker2:  it ’ s all religion . take the theory of the big bang . how is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion ? that ’ s no better than atlas carrying the globe on his back or african myths about turtles and stuff .  Speaker1:  turtles ? whatever . . . look , all that ’ s required for the creation of matter an imbalance of particles and anti - particles . at least , that ’ s what the math says .  Speaker2:  math , sheath . what ’ s the evidence ?  Speaker1:  there is evidence ! you know edwin hubble ? he ’ s the guy who in the early twentieth century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe , thus advancing notions of an expanding universe . what would it be expanding from ? well , the big bang . . . duh !

Speaker1: earning extra income on the internet is easier than you might think . after i started selling traditional craft items on the internet last year , i have really been able to make bank doing something i love . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  is that right ? i hear all these horror stories of internet business crashing because there is not enough of a customer base yet . how can you be sure your idea will cash in ?  Speaker1:  to run a successful internet business , it requires a little research and relatively small investment . you ' ve got to have a good idea of some kind of product that is in demand or would be popular . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  that ' s marketing research . . . but what about getting started once you have an idea ?  Speaker1:  after you have your great idea , then you can set up shop by registering a domain name , creating a website , an email address , and a hosting service . if you want to go all out on your website , you can put together shopping cart technology , but that can be pricey to start out with .

Speaker2:  like disco ?  Speaker1:  well , breakdancing is more a physical exercise than a dance . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  and disco a kind of nightclub .

Speaker2:  news about current affairs , documentaries , music , movies , noncommercial ads and so on .  Speaker1:  is there anything interesting ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  yes , there are something good and informative . i think that many people underestimate the value of tv in education .  Speaker1:  i agree . are there any commercials on the tv ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  of course . because the tv stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .  Speaker1:  that makes a lot of sense . does the tv work well ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  not always . it depends on the transmission of the satellite signals .  Speaker1:  i got it . do you pay for the programs ?

Speaker1:  you ' re a good student . i ' m sure you can do well . what you need to do is to relax .  Speaker2:  you ' re probably right . i just wish it were that simple . how can i stop feeling so anxious all the time ?  Speaker1:  taking a yoga class or learning some relaxation techniques can help you cope with your stress . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  i don ' t really have time to learn anything new . i need to spend my time studying !  Speaker1:  you need to take some breaks throughout the day . studying all day isn ’ t very usually effective .  Speaker2:  you ’ re right . i usually end up starting at my computer or checking my email instead of doing my work for class . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  besides , it ’ s not difficult to learn yoga . in fact , i can teach you a move that ’ s supposed to help you fall asleep ! you just have to sit down like this , bend over and breath in deeply .

Speaker1:  in college . but i don ' t dance very often . what ' s your favourite dance ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  it ' s hard to say . it depends . but i love the waltz .  Speaker1:  how about tango ?  Speaker2:  oh , i like it . it ' s such a beautiful dance , but i can ' t do it well . what about you ?  Speaker1:  tango is my favorite . anything but hip - hop or the foxtrot . ( the music has stopped ) _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  thank you for the dance .

Speaker1:  it wasn ' t just once . every single time i take the bus , something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus .  Speaker2:  we could take the subway , but we ' d have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice .  Speaker1:  train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare , too .  Speaker2:  if we don ' t hurry up , we ' ll miss the show . should we take the bus ?  Speaker1:  we ' re already late , so i think we had better take a taxi .

Speaker1:  seven children ? that ' s a lot . why did your parents have so many ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  well , my mother came from a big family , and wanted to have one of her own . my father was an only child , and didn ' t really care about having a large family , but my mother talked him into it .  Speaker1:  jeez , seven children . that must have a lot of problems . we have four children in my family and my grandparents can never get our names right .  Speaker2:  it can be hard , and there are certain sacrifices you have to make . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  like what ? i assume that there ' s no privacy .  Speaker2:  that ' s one . another is the lack of personal property . everything you have , from toys to clothes , is used by your brothers and sisters . especially clothes . three quarters of my wardrobe are hand - me - downs . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  and the age gap is also annoying . there ' s a ten - year difference between my younger brother and me . we have nothing in common .  Speaker2:  same problem here . there ' s an 18 - year gap between the oldest and youngest child in my family . the last child was born just as the oldest was going to college . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  well , at least going to college won ' t be too bad . since both of your parents are college professors , they must give you reduced tuition at the college .

Speaker1:  he was also assassinated because of his views .  Speaker2:  he is known as american ' s greatest president . do you know why ? because he fought against slavery and secession at a time in history where others were too afraid to do anything . he succeeded because of his ambition and generous spirit .  Speaker1:  well , if he can become president , then i can at least get a promotion .

Speaker2:  oh , i see how this food can be really hard for you . i can sympathize with that . i stayed in sichuan for a year . the food was difficult at the beginning . every dish was so spicy . after a while though , i got used to the taste , and now i won ' t consider anything a real dish if it isn ' t spicy .  Speaker1:  yeah , you can increase you tolerance for spicy food , but so far , i haven ' t had the need or the opportunity . every time i try spicy food , it is a total disaster for my nose and eyes . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  i completely understand . i didn ' t intend on liking spicy food at first either , but when you have no other choices , you ' ve got to adapt .  Speaker1:  yeah , i guess that ' s a typical example of ' when in rome , do as the romans do . '

Speaker1: bob ! your eyes look bloodshot . did you not sleep well ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  i had a drop too much last night . i attended a banquet given by a chinese colleague of mine . and it was startling for me to find that people are forced to drink against their will on a chinese table .  Speaker1:  you have it right . alcohol is a medium for communicating emotion in china . drinking with business partners or would - be friends is a way of solidifying friendship , especially in northern china . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  i just felt embarrassed if i refused to drink when people toasted to me . but if i keep gulping down one cup after another , i ' m afraid i would feel unfit or sick .  Speaker1:  you lose face by refusing to drink , and the host might think you refuse to give him face . the right thing to do seems to be drinking yourself into incoherence until you throw up . this will endear you  Speaker2:  a few guys even threw a drunken fit last night , crying hoarsely and bawling whole heaps of nonsense that i never understood . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  then he must be opening his heart to the friends . in a word , as long as you demonstrate a readiness to drink more in spite of already suffering extreme discomfort , no one will jeer at you .

Speaker2:  yes , jane was quite upset about it . the manager came to apologize and we did get free dessert , but still . . . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  i would think this was the least they could do .  Speaker2:  in the end it was a nice evening and i got an ipad as my birthday present which i wanted for a while .  Speaker1:  great . i have also been thinking of getting one . do you think you could ask jane to have a quiet word with margaret ? my birthday is not that far away .

Speaker2:  horowitz , i beg to differ . even in your most recent study , the investigative approach was flawed ! you know as well as i do that the collection of data was not systematic , and there is a large margin of error . to draw a definitive conclusion based on that data would be misleading  Speaker1:  that is preposterous !  Speaker2:  you are trying to single - handedly solve one of the world ’ s greatest mysteries , and yet you are oblivious to the fact that you are wrong ! _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  i am not wrong ! the chicken came first !

Speaker2:  no . i ' m going to pay the bill for the company ' s lunch .  Speaker1:  but you didn ' t eat anything today . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  well , the bill is paid by month . that ' s probably the only thing that i like about a take - out restaurant .

Speaker1:  no , i never did . it ' s for my son . he loves it , and i made an agreement with him that he can eat it once a week .  Speaker2:  that ' s really smart . my son daniel is the same with your son . i just don ' t get it , why all the kids prefer western food to traditional food . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  me , either . but , it ' s for sure that the children market is a really big one .

Speaker1: thanks for offering to give me a lift . i ' m looking forward to this party , but i didn ' t want to go alone .  Speaker2:  don ' t mention it . it ' s my pleasure . have you been to one of these large , sit - down dinner parties since you got to new haven ? _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  no , this is my first . last week i went to a cookout 5 for new professors at dean barksdale ' s home . i took a taxi because i didn ' t want to be late . but i was the first one there .  Speaker2:  i ' ll bet you were a little embarrassed . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  you ' re right . the invitation said two to seven . i was there at two o ' clock , but most people didn ' t arrive until three or four . they didn ' t start cooking until five o ’ clock .  Speaker2:  cookouts often start slowly . a two o ' clock start means you arrive any time after two . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  thanks for telling me this .  Speaker2:  i was late getting back from the mall , but i ' m hurrying .  Speaker1:  why are you in such a hurry ? they said , dinner at eight , and it ' s only seven - fifteen . i don ' t want to be the first one there again .

Speaker1: how do you usually get to school ?  Speaker2:  i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ? _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle , but when i feel lazy , i drive my car .  Speaker2:  i think we should discourage people from using their private cars . they produce too much pollution !  Speaker1:  i agree , but i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it ' s just so convenient .  Speaker2:  cars might be convenient , but they ' re so bad for the environment .  Speaker1:  do you have a car ?  Speaker2:  no . i used to have one though . once i started using my bicycle to get around , i found that i didn ' t really need it .  Speaker1:  maybe if i sold my car now , i wouldn ' t be so tempted to use it .  Speaker2:  you could try . it would save you a lot of money . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  that ' s true . every month , i spend hundreds of dollars on gas , insurance , and repairs .  Speaker2:  if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving , you will get lots of exercise , too !  Speaker1:  i could stand to lose a few pounds . having a car has made me lazy . i never end up walking anywhere !

Speaker1: did you see the way that brian came to work yesterday ? ever since he came back from that conference in silicon valley , he ' s been coming to work dressed in jeans and sweatshirts . it ' s like he ' s decided to make himself at home in his office . i don ' t know how long it ' ll take before the management talks to him about it .  Speaker2:  he was really influenced by the way they do things on the west coast . i guess the working atmosphere is a lot more relaxed and casual in california . it comes from the information technology industry . . there isn ' t such a large division between home and office , so people want to work in the clothes they feel more relaxed in .  Speaker1:  maybe so , but it seems kind of strange , which the rest of us in white shirts , dark suites , and ties .  Speaker2:  it ' s not as bad as that . . . we are allowed to wear more casual jackets and trousers . besides , didn ' t you hear what brian found on his desk this morning ? _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  what ' s that ?

Speaker1:  of course i do . i love it . all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  that ' s true . for various reasons , it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . you know , the low temperature may cause many problems .  Speaker1:  yeah . what ' s the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?  Speaker2:  when the olympic games started in modern times , only summer events were included . when it grew popular , there came the winter olympic games , which includes a variety of winter sports . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  i see . then , what ' s your favorite winter sport ?  Speaker2:  figure skating . in my eye , nothing beats it . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  then you must know shen due and hao hongbo .  Speaker2:  oh , i didn ' t expect you to know them . but yes , i love them not only because of many medals they ' ve won , but also because of their spirits .  Speaker1:  you should go to talk with may . she is a big fan of them too . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  sure . what about you ? what do you like about the olympics ?  Speaker1:  for me , the olympics for the disabled always catches my heart . it makes me understand that perseverance makes the impossible possible .

Speaker2:  that ' s right . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  i also know they are given to other countries as gifts for friendship .  Speaker2:  you sound quite knowledgeable . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  not really , panda is my favorite animal .  Speaker2:  actually , it likes milk too .

Speaker1:  no , not at all . it looks really classy on you . where did you pick that up ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  i got it on sale down at the department store .  Speaker1:  when did you go there ?  Speaker2:  i was just there a couple of days ago . you know , you should go down there too . they have a lot of stylish clothes on sale . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  i might just do that . what style of clothes do they have ?  Speaker2:  anything you want . they have both casual and formal styles . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  i was hoping to get a few new ties for my collection .  Speaker2:  that ' s a good idea . some of your ties are pretty outdated .  Speaker1:  well , i spent a lot of money on getting my shirts tailor - made , so i couldn ' t afford to buy any new ties . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  anyways , are you going to the party tonight ?  Speaker1:  yes , i am . say , are you going to wear that outfit to the party ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  i don ' t think so . it is a little too formal . i ' m probably going to wear something more laid back .  Speaker1:  me too . i will probably go dressed in a t - shirt and jeans . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  i guess that you will really be dressing down .  Speaker1:  that ' s my style when i ' m not in the office .

Speaker1: hello , jim . what was the film like ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  awful . it was a complete waste of time .  Speaker1:  why ? what was it about ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  it was about a married couple . they had to live with the wife ' s mother , because they didn ' t have enough money to buy a house of their own .  Speaker1:  a lot of young people have to do that .  Speaker2:  yes . but the husband had to work overtime three times a week , so he was always tired .  Speaker1:  lt sounds like the story of my life . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  yes , it does , doesn ' t it ? but this man was always over - tired , and he couldn ' t sleep . so he used to take two sleeping pill every night .  Speaker1:  i take sleeping pills sometimes . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  yes , but not two every night . anyway , the strain was too much for him . he had nervous breakdown and had to go to hospital .  Speaker1:  it sounds a very depressing film .

 | 
Speaker1: i don ' t know why people are just mad about david peckham . is there really anything so fascinating with him ?  Speaker2:  he appeals to the fans thanks to two things  Speaker1:  you mean he plays well ? yeah , he often scores by free kicks in crucial games . but a football match is by no means merely a show of taking free kicks .  Speaker2:  certainly not . what really counts is to play as a team , passing the ball amongst each other , dodging defenders . free kicks are a result of all the teammates ' collective efforts . however , a few free kicks often make everything different , especially scoring one such goal in the nick of time .  Speaker1:  in the case , maybe facial charm should be his leading card . after all , the majority of his fans are girls .

Speaker1:  oh , it ' s love at first sight . when will you see each other again ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  he didn ' t say , but he said he would call me .  Speaker1:  maybe he is busy with his work . just wait and try not to think about it too much !  Speaker2:  oh , steve . stop it ! i am a bit nervous ! what if he doesn ' t call ? _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  come on , mary , you ' re a total catch . i bet he will call you . don ' t worry .

Speaker1: if i won the pools , i ' d go round the world . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  would you ? i wouldn ' t .  Speaker1:  what would you do ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  oh , i don ' t know . i ' d buy a big house with a garden for my wife and kids , i suppose . but it ' s difficult to imagine having a lot of money .  Speaker1:  one thing ' s certain . if i had a lot of money , i wouldn ' t work any more . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  wouldn ' t you ? what would you do with all that spare time ?  Speaker1:  as i said , i ' d go round the world .  Speaker2:  what would you do after that ?  Speaker1:  oh , i don ' t know . it ' d take me a long time to go round the world . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  it doesn ' t sound very exciting .  Speaker1:  anyway , we haven ' t won the pools , and we ' re not likely to win them . so there isn ' t much point in talking about it , is there ?  Speaker2:  i ' d be happy if i got a rise . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  and my wife would be happy if i bought her a mink coat .  Speaker2:  well , i ' m not likely to get a rise and you haven ' t the money for a mink coat , so let ' s come down to earth and have another drink . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  what ' ll you have ?  Speaker2:  i ' ll have a pint of the best .  Speaker1:  i ' d have a scotch if i were you . we deserve it .
 | 
Speaker1: have you thought of moving at all , sarah ?  Speaker2:  we ’ ve thought about it , but my husband and i can ’ t afford it right now . the only thing we could afford would be living in the slums , which is something i don ’ t want to do . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  buying a house can be expensive , but there are ways to find cheaper houses .  Speaker2:  like what ? _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  well , sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community . you ’ d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day , but you would definitely save money doing it that way .  Speaker2:  that ’ s a good idea . do you know anyone who has done that before ?  Speaker1:  sure , my sister - in - law and her husband just bought a house that way . they ’ re pretty satisfied with it . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  is the house pretty run - down .  Speaker1:  not at all . the woman , who owned it , took good care of it . but when she died , she had no family left and no will , so the government had to sell it for her .

Speaker1: which church do you attend ?  Speaker2:  i am mormon , so i go to the church of jesus christ of latter day saints . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  what ’ s the difference between this and other churches ?  Speaker2:  mormons believe that , after the death of christ and the death of the apostles 10 , their church christ founded became corrupt and the authority of christ on earth was lost to men . in 1830 , a prophet named joseph smith was brought up by god to restore the church . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  then does that mean the other churches are corrupt ?  Speaker2:  that means that they all have parts of the original gospel , but not all .  Speaker1:  do you believe that mormons have all of it ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  yes .  Speaker1:  why do you really go to church ?

Speaker1:  i hope to major in english literature , but the admissions counselor told me that many people change their major many times in their first year , so we ’ ll see .

Speaker2:  me too . do you think we are boring people ?  Speaker1:  i don ' t think we are boring . it ' s just that we don ' t have any hobbies . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  that ' s right . what do you think we should do as a hobby ?  Speaker1:  that all depends on what you like to do . for example , i like to doodle on the notepad , so i ' m thinking about doing some real drawings . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  i like to play the piano for fun .

Speaker1: which team do you think will emerge with the last laugh in this world cup ?  Speaker2:  i wish it could be germany . but it seems they are not in a very good conditions . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  no , they aren ' t . they had a hard time in the group stage and only sealed a sit in the eighth - finals with wallack ' s header in the final three minutes . just think , group a consists of austria , china , and saudi arabia , all of which are minnows .  Speaker2:  it seems they ' ve been out of luck since the beginning of the event . their shots hit the woodwork as many as six times . oh . my goodness ! i ' m afraid the team is under a spell . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  well , at least the germans have demonstrated a very good ability to control the midfield . they recorded a total of 62 tackles in the match against austria . and they to be endowed with perfect positional sense . i think that will give rise to scoring chances sooner or later .  Speaker2:  i agree . eeven though german attackers are not good at dribbling past opposing defenders , they breach the defensive line through quick movements to the right attacking positions and through accurate , well - timed passes .  Speaker1:  that ' s why i still have very high hopes for the team . now that the tournament has proceeded into the knock - out stage , the germans will probably make it through to the finals .

Speaker1: have we sold out all the newspapers for today ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  yes . what a good job we have done !  Speaker1:  why are so many extra gifts left here ?  Speaker2:  many customers didn ' t want them .  Speaker1:  how about giving them to that old man ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  good idea .  Speaker1:  by the way , do you think it ' s a good idea to give free gifts to attract customers ?  Speaker2:  i ' m not sure , but still it did attract a large crowds today .  Speaker1:  i think it should be more useful to hand out some fliers which is also cheaper . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  but people can just throw them into the trash can as they turn around .  Speaker1:  that ' s true .
 | 
Speaker1: look at these clothes designed by top fashion designer like versacci , calvin klein , and vivienne westwood . what do you think of them ?  Speaker2:  well , they look lovely , but they ’ re not very practical . i mean , would you wear that dress to the office or walking down the street ? _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  i know what you mean . people would stare at you in amazement if you wore something like that in an everyday situation . i suppose only extravagant rich people wear them at cocktail parties .  Speaker2:  maybe . i ’ m not sure why they have fashion shows like this . hardly anyone will buy those clothes . the clothes you see are nothing like the ones that ordinary people wear . it seems like a waste of money .  Speaker1:  i think that the designers hold these fashion shows for a few reasons . first , it ’ s just like a big party . they can meet each other and network . the other thing is that it is great advertising . all the journalists and photographers are there . thirdly , it give them a chance to show what they would like to see people wearing . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  you meant it ’ s an expression of their fantasies ?  Speaker1:  yes . i think the designers are saying that these clothes are what they would like to see people wear if those people weren ’ t concerned with what other people might think . in a way , the designers are saying ‘ don ’ t worry about what others think . wear what you like ! ’ .

Speaker1:  how often ?  Speaker2:  well , we come here almost every month .  Speaker1:  who ’ s that ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  it ’ s my mother . she ’ s fond of swimming . and the man beside her is my father .  Speaker1:  do you like swimming ?

Speaker1:  no . those you have to provide for yourself . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  what do most of the students do ?  Speaker1:  well , most of them only need a cap and gown for that particular convocation service , but some of the education majors have had them made , because they will be faculty members , and they ' ll need them f  Speaker2:  then , i might as well have them made . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  mary , don ' t move . stand right there . it ' s a good shot . the background is very pretty .

 | 
Speaker1: i ' m really sick of waiting for a bus . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  yeah . especially when you have something urgent to do .  Speaker1:  but a taxi costs too much .
 | 
Speaker1: can you do push - ups ?  Speaker2:  of course i can . it ' s a piece of cake ! believe it or not , i can do 30 push - ups a minute . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  really ? i think that ' s impossible !  Speaker2:  you mean 30 push - ups ? _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  yeah !

 | 
Speaker1: which social problem do you think the government needs to concentrate on most ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  i think housing is a big problem . there are thousands of homeless people on the streets .  Speaker1:  how would you solve the problem ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  i have a good idea to solve it . the government could provide some money for homeless people to build their own homes .  Speaker1:  it would probably be very expensive . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  i think the government can afford it . besides , there are many advantages . homeless people would find it easier to get jobs if they had an address . they would learn some useful skill for finding jobs in the construction industry or home improvement .  Speaker1:  it ’ s not a bad idea . i think education is the biggest problem at the moment . schools don ’ t seem to have enough money to educate kids properly . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  if we are to invest more money to education , we will need to raise taxes . that wouldn ’ t be popular with voters .  Speaker1:  most voters what everything bout ways . they want the government to pay for lots of things , but without increasing taxes .

Speaker2:  how about your tongue ? does it still hurt ? _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  no , the burn ointment seemed to take effect right away . i think it ' s already healed .  Speaker2:  how did you get that burn again ?  Speaker1:  i scalded on the hot coffee a few days ago . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  you haven ' t had much luck lately , have you ?

Speaker1:  what methods do you use to conserve water ?  Speaker2:  water is rationed . we can only use a certain amount each month . it means that we cannot use some modern household items , like washing machines . they use too much water . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  i see . i think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution .  Speaker2:  yes , i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course , my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .  Speaker1:  we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years , but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .

Speaker1: hey , what sort of drinks do you want ? gatorade or water ?

Speaker2:  what should we do , now with jack out of the game ?  Speaker1:  we should choose from the backups . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  that ’ s right . spraining the ankle and breaking the leg are the common things during the match .  Speaker1:  that ’ s why we should learn to protect ourselves . otherwise , the game is not worth the candle .

 | 
Speaker1: you should have seen the t . v . show that was on last night , the topic it covered was really interesting , animal rights .  Speaker2:  do you really believe in that ? if they are going to focus on something , they should do it on civil rights .  Speaker1:  yes , but we can ’ t deny that animals are vulnerable , defenseless , and are completely at the mercy of human beings .  Speaker2:  i understand your point , but we continue to have transgressions against human rights . if so much attention weren ’ t devoted to the topic of animals , we would then concentrate more on saving a human being instead of protecting a koala .  Speaker1:  you can ’ t compare apples and oranges . i believe that both topics are important and that we can ’ t ignore them , the mistreatment of animals can cause a great environmental imbalance . i believe that governments should prohibit activities like poaching .  Speaker2:  well , you are right on that point . this is the reason that i don ’ t buy leather and i try to buy synthetic products .  Speaker1:  at least you ’ re doing your part . my contribution is to have a pet in the house that i treat like a member of the family .

Speaker2:  yeah but , it is something that you will have forever ! they use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . on top of all that , i have heard it hurts a lot !  Speaker1:  really ?  Speaker2:  of course ! they use this machine with a needle that pokes your skin and inserts the ink .  Speaker1:  oh , i didn ’ t know that ! i thought they just paint it on your skin or something .

Speaker1: look , here ' re two coins named kai yuan tong bao — the sort of coin made in memory of the founding of a new dynasty . these two coins were made in different periods of the tang dynasty .

Speaker1:  various methods were used in history to produce fake coins . we usually send the coin to an authorized unit to have it tested by experts with special machines . we can judge it with naked eyes . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  i see . by the way , china was more than once ruled by foreign tribes in history . did they issue their own coins in china ?  Speaker1:  certainly , they did . liao coins and song coins , for example , coexisted in circulation during the southern song and yuan period some 800 - 1000 years ago . the liao coins look plain and bold in style , just like the characteristics of the mongolian tribe . let me look for one and show you .

Speaker2:  i would have liked them to be there , but they couldn ’ t afford to fly out to see us , and we couldn ' t afford to fly out to see them , so they understood . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  did your husband ' s family get to meet your family ?  Speaker2:  my husband ' s parents flew out to meet my family when we got married in my hometown , so that was great . some people spend ridiculous amounts of money on extravagant wedding receptions , but we agreed that the wedding party should be less about money and more about family .  Speaker1:  that makes sense . did you go on a honeymoon ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  we waited until our one - year anniversary to go on our honeymoon to africa .  Speaker1:  you really didn ' t have a very traditional wedding , did you ?

Speaker2:  actually , i don ' t think you can call the police . not yet at least . he hasn ' t done anything . and probably the police will just ignore it . but if anything happens again , then maybe you should call .  Speaker1:  why can ' t i call the police now ? he was definitely following me !  Speaker2:  of course you can call the police if you want . that ' s not what i mean . i ' m just saying that they probably won ' t do anything .  Speaker1:  i suppose . what can they do ? i don ' t even know who he is .

Speaker2:  sure . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  do you get much rain during the summer ?  Speaker2:  plenty . we never worry about lack of rainwater in our area . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  so you should bring an umbrella often .

Speaker1: what are you reading about in that science magazine ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  there are several interesting articles on recent scientific breakthroughs . i just finished reading one about cloning .  Speaker1:  i ’ m not sure i like the idea of that . i don ’ t want people copying me or other people . it could be very confusing .  Speaker2:  according to the article , you have no real need to worry . research nowadays is focussing on cloning parts of a human body to replace damaged or lost parts , not on recreating a whole human . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  in the future , that could be possible .  Speaker2:  in this article , scientists say that if you took the genes from someone and tried to create a copy of a person , there ’ s no guarantee that the copy would look or act like the original ! _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  really ? what else have you discovered ?

Speaker1:  what kind of things did you learn ?  Speaker2:  she taught us that you can do anything that you want to do .  Speaker1:  anything ? do you really believe that we can do anything ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  if you really want to do something and you work hard at it , i believe you can do it .  Speaker1:  you said she was strict . did she have a lot of rules ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  she had some rules that helped us to feel comfortable . for example , the students had to treat each other with respect , or they would be disciplined .  Speaker1:  i see . she sounds like she really cared about her students . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  yes . she treated us all fairly . she don ’ t have any teacher ’ s pets .  Speaker1:  really ? doesn ’ t every teacher have a teacher ’ s pet ?  Speaker2:  well . to be honest , i usually sucked up to teachers because i wanted them to give me good grades . however , miss baymler didn ’ t treat me any differently . she really didn ’ t have any teacher ’ s pets .  Speaker1:  do you know what she is doing now ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  as a matter of fact , i do . after she taught our class , she got married and moved to another city . then , she started writing children ’ s book .  Speaker1:  have you ever read one of the books ?  Speaker2:  of course ! both children and adults enjoy her books . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  why don ’ t you recommend one to me ?

Speaker1: get up as early as six o ' clock only to be jammed at every crossroad and still late for work . what a life ! i ' ve had enough of it .  Speaker2:  cool down , man . everyone is fed up with the rush - hour traffic . but life isn ' t really all that . you should take the initiative and make some changes first .  Speaker1:  what should i do then ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  i recommend you ride a bike instead of commuting by bus . it may offer you many benefits . first , it ' s good for your health . i ' m afraid it ' s not necessary for me to further elaborate . while lots of people spend time like an hour each morning exercising , a bike ride to work not only builds you up , but also makes full use of time . you might as well sleep out for a longer hour .  Speaker1:  i know cycling is always a more favorable choice than a bus . after all , it ' s a sport . but do you think it a pleasant experience to take in the dirty , polled air on the road ?

Speaker1:  yes , i do . i find it very relaxing . i often listen to mozart or bach in the evening after a hard day at work .  Speaker2:  i must admit that i like several pieces of classical music . it ’ s certainly more sophisticated that modern dance music .  Speaker1:  classical music is supposed to be good for you brain . research suggest that it makes your brain more active . students who listen to classical music while studying perform better .  Speaker2:  really ? perhaps i should listen to classical music often . i heard that listening to classical music is helpful in reducing stress . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  yes . that ’ s why i listen to it in the evenings . i usually play it as background music while i ’ m cooking or doing other housework .  Speaker2:  i ’ ve got a few classical music cd ’ s . i should follow your lead and increase my brian power .

Speaker1:  yes . are you traveling here ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  yes , i ' m from taiwan . i never heard of a gas station where you fill up your own car .  Speaker1:  in america , most gas stations are like this . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  do i really have to do it ? i don ' t know how .  Speaker1:  well , since this is your first time , i will do it for you . but next time , if you want a full - service gas station , you should look at the sign .  Speaker2:  what sign ? _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  under the sign for the gas station , there will be a smaller sign that says self - serve or full - service . and some gas stations have both . but if they have both , some pumps will be self - serve and some will be full - serve . you have to look at the signs .

Speaker1: sorry , i overslept . my alarm clock didn ' t go off this morning .  Speaker2:  again ?  Speaker1:  that ' s right , even though i did set the alarm last night .  Speaker2:  your clock never works . perhaps you should buy a new one .  Speaker1:  well . if it breaks down again tomorrow , i ' ll definitely buy a new one . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  maybe by then it will be too late .  Speaker1:  what do you mean too late ?
 | 
Speaker1: can you take part in our picnic this saturday ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  that would be fine . where are you going ?

Speaker1:  and don ' t forget your fishing tackle .

Speaker1: hello , zhang lin ! fancy meeting you here !  Speaker2:  hi , lin tao . i have ' t seen you for some time .  Speaker1:  how ' s life going , zhang lin ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  yes , the same as ever , thanks . what about you ?  Speaker1:  pretty good , thanks . i ' m going to see my uncle .
 | 
Speaker1: hi , mr . zhang . what ’ s wrong ? you don ’ t look so happy . how was your date ?  Speaker2:  i was turned down again . it ’ s frustrating . i guess you ’ ve got to teach me some skills .  Speaker1:  me ? i ’ m even less experienced than you are . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  at least you know what american women generally like in a man .  Speaker1:  believe it or not , i guess american women like a man in good shape , which chinese women may not care about so much . that ’ s my honest opinion . i know you have been trying very hard .  Speaker2:  american men are naturally taller than chinese men . so even if i exercise , there aren ’ t many chances .  Speaker1:  no , that ’ s not true . i ’ ve met two american women who were married to chinese . but those chinese look very strong and healthy . so if you exercise more often , i bet it will surely be easier for you to date american girls . how old is jacky chan ? he ’ s small and short . but i bet he can have any american woman he wants .

Speaker1: oh dear , miss , you are soaked ! wow , it ' s really raining heavily outside .  Speaker2:  yes , it sure is . i had to run here from work ! i need to rush as i ' m on my lunch break .

Speaker1:  my pleasure miss . actually , could you recommend what to eat here ? i ' ve never been here before .  Speaker2:  sure . well , the avocado sandwich is delicious , and it ' s the healthiest thing on the menu . personally , i think the beef salad is the tastiest choice . i usually get that . also , the milkshakes are the best milkshakes in town !  Speaker1:  well , thanks for the suggestions .

Speaker1: management is going through a big turnover these days . with bill ' s retirement , and department realignment , we have lost about 1 / 3 of our managerial staff . they ' ve been dropping like flies . . . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  isn ' t that a good thing ? having fewer bosses means having less stress , don ' t you think ?  Speaker1:  actually , i don ' t think so . supervisors are really important to make sure everything goes smoothly in the workplace . they are necessary for divvying up work and disciplining employees . if there is no one to keep an eye on us , no one would get any work done . you know what they say , when the cat ' s away , the mice play .
 | 
Speaker1: hurry up ! time is money !  Speaker2:  don ' t build a fire under me . i know the importance of time . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  but you are too slow to follow them .

Speaker2:  you like it , but it ' s getting to be a handicap for you .  Speaker1:  hey , that ' s enough about my hair .  Speaker2:  i know a great hairdresser not far from here and she is cute too .  Speaker1:  i don ' t go to hairdressers because they ' re cute .

Speaker1:  very beautiful and very interesting . but why do you hang them in the tree ?
 | 
Speaker1: who did the stupid thing ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  maybe it was dick .  Speaker1:  i don ' t think so . dick has been on the ball and never does things like that .
 | 
Speaker1: jack wonders whether linda likes him or not . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  why doesn ' t he ask her ?  Speaker1:  he is too scared to ask her .
 | 
Speaker1: it ' s wonderful to be in the mountains after a hustle bustle week .  Speaker2:  indeed . i love the smell of the grass and trees . they certainly refresh my mind . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  can we stop here for a while ? my backpack is very heavy .  Speaker2:  sure . did you hear anything ? look ! an eagle is hovering in the sky .  Speaker1:  let me see . it ' s not an eagle . i think it ' s a vulture .

Speaker2:  ok . i have a good pair of hiking boots . it should not be a big problem .  Speaker1:  i also brought a bottle of water and some provisions . if you are hungry , you can let me know . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  you are kind . look there is a big tree over there , it looks like a thousand - year - old tree .

Speaker1: craig , what do you do for work ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  i ' m still a student .  Speaker1:  what school do you go to ?

Speaker1:  i see . talking with other people is very important .  Speaker2:  yes , but i still don ' t have many friends here yet . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  i ' m having a party tonight at my apartment . you should come .
 | 
Speaker1: do you think children watch too much tv ?  Speaker2:  i only allow my child to watch up to an hour a day . i don ’ t think that tv is bad for kids . i think that kids should be active and not become couch potatoes .  Speaker1:  perhaps i should impose a limit on how much tv my kids can watch . they don ’ t do much else in their free time . at least they always do their homework first .  Speaker2:  if you decide to put a limit on the amount of tv they can watch , remember to have something else for them to do . if you don ’ t , they ’ ll get bored and misbehave . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  they could go out and play with their friends .  Speaker2:  sure . you could talk to other parents in your neighbourhood and plan it so that all the kids are free at the same time . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  perhaps i could ask my husband to teach them foot ball or some thing . he watches too much tv too .

Speaker1: do you know anything about dr . miller ' s classes ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  yes . are you in his class ?  Speaker1:  i ' m thinking of taking his class next semester . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  he really knew his stuff , but he graded hard . would that be ok ?  Speaker1:  yes , i really need someone who is really good .  Speaker2:  i didn ' t find it overwhelming to earn a good grade if you work at it . can you do that ? _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  maybe , but i ' m not sure .  Speaker2:  man , this guy was so funny when he was teaching . i like that , don ' t you ? _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  no , that stuff isn ' t important to me .

Speaker1: thank you for showing me your offices , mr . becker . i can see why washington bureaucrats enjoy their jobs .  Speaker2:  why do you say that ?  Speaker1:  the city is beautiful , the off . . . , the offices are modern and comfortable , and the work is so interesting .  Speaker2:  many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . government service can be a rewarding and secure career .  Speaker1:  do you mean financially rewarding ?  Speaker2:  well , many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries .  Speaker1:  i ' ve always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy .  Speaker2:  sometimes that ' s true , but not usually . most feds are honest , hard - working professionals . it ’ s hard to keep highly trained people , so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive .  Speaker1:  how much do you make ?
 | 
Speaker1: is the view going to be ok ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  don ’ t worry , you did a good job and it should be fine .  Speaker1:  i ’ ll do my best .

Speaker1:  well , you have to take the bad with the good .
 | 
Speaker1: excuse me , professor . i am going to miss next week ' s class . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  is this something that you could schedule for another time ?

Speaker1:  i ' ve made arrangements with a friend to help me . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  you know that i only allow one absence per semester , don ' t you ?  Speaker1:  yes , i know .

Speaker1:  maybe you just need a few pick - up lines , you know , break the ice .  Speaker2:  pick - up lines don ' t work !  Speaker1:  come on ! you can just walk up to a girl and say “ if you were a booger i \ ' d pick you first . ”  Speaker2:  what ? come on ! that ’ s just lame ! no girl would fall for that ! _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  fine , then you can say , “ so there you are ! i ' ve been looking all over for you , the woman of my dreams ! ”  Speaker2:  that ' s a good one ! i think that ' s pretty funny .  Speaker1:  yeah , so you make her laugh , you make a fool of yourself a little bit and then you buy her a drink .
 | 
Speaker1: i ’ m sorry , dad . but you can ’ t do that . it ’ s for me to decide . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  oh , i see . you ’ ve already decided , have you ? now , you listen to me , you ’ re only 19 .

Speaker1:  what do you mean ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  well , i mean . we always do the same thing . there ' s no variety in our lives .  Speaker1:  you need a holiday . that ' s what ' s the matter .
 | 
Speaker1: hey , what ' s the matter ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  it doesn ' t matter . i just feel a little dizzy .  Speaker1:  are you sure that this has nothing to do with sleep ?
 | 
Speaker1: how was your education going on in australia ?  Speaker2:  i ' m going to graduate this summer .  Speaker1:  where are you going to work then , in australia or back in china ?  Speaker2:  i ' m planning to return to china after graduation . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  why are you choosing to leave a foreign country ? many people are reluctant to leave the superior living environment abroad .
 | 
Speaker1: are you working overtime again ? over the last two weeks , you have worked overtime every day without a break ! your company is draining the life out of you !  Speaker2:  i know , but i don ' t have a choice , my boss has complete control over our work schedules . i haven ' t made it out of the office before 9 pm a single day this week .  Speaker1:  well , i hope they ' re paying you the big bucks for all this work . . .  Speaker2:  no , not exactly , i ' m working for minimum wage . and they don ' t give extra pay for overtime . overtime is our own time .  Speaker1:  what ? ! isn ' t there a law against that , i think there is some legislation that requires employers to give their employees a fair rate of wages . you should know your rights ! if you are putting in so many hours , they should give you some kind of compensation .  Speaker2:  they do give bonuses at the end of the year for the employees with highest productivity numbers , but frankly , it ' s not much of an incentive . they give us a bonus of ten dollars . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  that ' s just wrong ! why don ' t you just quit ?
 | 
Speaker1: david , i ’ m going to china .

Speaker1:  we need to say something about the geography and climate of china . is there any way to divide the country into sections ?  Speaker2:  we could divide into five parts . there ’ s the northeast , which is mild in summer and very cold in winter . then there is the northwest , which is largely desert . tillet is famous for its mountainous climate . the rest of the country can be roughly divided into two parts . one is temperate - mild in winter and warm in summer . then , in the south it is hot most of the year . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  that sounds very general .  Speaker2:  it is , buy remember that we only have a few minutes to make our presentation . we can select cities from each part and give data for each one .  Speaker1:  one from each part ? lhasa , urumqi , harbin , shanghai , and hongkong . the capital city is beijing , right ?

Speaker1:  and when do you prepare for your final exam ?  Speaker2:  honestly speaking , most students prepare it one month before the exam .  Speaker1:  really ? you only review your lessons in one month ? does it work ?  Speaker2:  of course , it ' s useful . and it ' s very crucial to have the copies of teacher ' s notes , because most questions in the exam are based on them . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  wow , and all the key points are included in them ? you ' re so smart !  Speaker2:  but the exam is not as simple as you may imagine . we have to stay up late .  Speaker1:  do you have the classrooms open for the whole night ?

Speaker2:  but we can ' t have thirteen for dinner ! _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  i think you ' re making a mountain out of a molehill . it ' s only a superstition . it really doesn ' t mean anything .

 | 
Speaker1: what a pin - up she is ! _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  can you imagine she ' s over forty ?  Speaker1:  that ' s incredible ! she has such a sharp figure .
 | 
Speaker1: i feel like going for a drink , it ' s been a long day .  Speaker2:  great idea ! peter , i could use the drink .  Speaker1:  how about the new bar across road ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  sounds good . the food there is fantastic too .  Speaker1:  i agree , i had lunch there last week .
 |

Speaker1:  i ’ ve studied home decoration as a hobby . could i make some suggestions ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  go right ahead .  Speaker1:  well , i think a crystal chandelier would look great in your living room , and maybe some new drapes for the windows . also , a grandfather clock would look great in the den . perhaps you could buy some potted plants for the dining room

 | 
Speaker1: diana , in your opinion , which is more important , iq or eq ?  Speaker2:  why are you asking me the strange question , jerry ?  Speaker1:  i watched the movie forrest gump last night . and the question just lined in my mind . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  well . i think iq matters more . but it won ' t work without eq .  Speaker1:  why ? you seem pretty sure about it .  Speaker2:  because an intellectual mind can only be a beneficial thing in life .  Speaker1:  but iq is decided at birth . one can ' t expect to make a lot of improvement in it .  Speaker2:  that ' s why people ' s achievement varies greatly . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  that ' s true , but what if one comes across some difficulties . he must rely on his eq to deal with them .  Speaker2:  yes , jerry , can you share your understanding of eq ? _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  i think it is independent of iq and plays a prominent role in deciding the way we live our lives .  Speaker2:  quite right . have you noticed that a high iq is not a must for one ' s success ? _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  just as forrest ?

Speaker2:  no ! i said i was going to cut down which is very different . you can ’ t just expect me to go cold turkey overnight !  Speaker1:  look , there are other ways to quit . you can try the nicotine patch , or nicotine chewing gum . we spend a fortune on cigarettes every month and now laws are cracking down and not allowing smoking in any public place . it ’ s not like you can just light up like before .

Speaker1:  yeah , you are right . i must stop complaining and stick to it every day .

Speaker1:  instead of tackling somebody , you just have to touch them with two hands , or if it is flag football , grab the flag that the ball carrier is wearing .  Speaker2:  i see . it ' s safer then right ? _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  exactly . we play every saturdays on the field by the tennis courts . if you want to learn and play a little , you ' re welcome to join us .

Speaker2:  don ' t tell me you actually believe all that ? don ' t be so gullible , they are just urban legends . they are just stories people make up to scare you .  Speaker1:  well , i was also reading about how some popular songs have subliminal or even satanic messages if you play them backwards ! can you believe that ?

Speaker1: the air quality in this city is horrendous . the pollution levels are so high that we are not supposed to go outside with a face mask again !  Speaker2:  exhaust fumes from vehicles cause a great deal of damage to the environment .  Speaker1:  on top of that , there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs , which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  as much as i love this city , i think i ' m going to find a greener city to live in . living in a polluted city like this just can ' t be good for my health .  Speaker1:  i know what you mean . however , there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming . if it ' s not the pollution , then it ' s the natural disasters , deforestation , or the greenhouse effect . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  what is the greenhouse effect exactly ?  Speaker1:  it ' s the gradual rise in the earth ' s temperature .  Speaker2:  i see , so it ' s similar to global warming ? _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  they ' re related to one another , yes .  Speaker2:  i heard that some people in england are pleased with the fact that the climate is becoming warmer because it ' s making their towns a more pleasant place to live .  Speaker1:  people joke about the benefits of the increase in temperature , but it ' s not all good news . they ' ve been experiencing a lot of deadly storms there as well .
 | 
Speaker1: hi , long time no see . how have you been ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  oh , i ' ve been fine , but i ' m having some trouble with my son .  Speaker1:  tell me all about it . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  oh , he ' s 14 and in the past few months , he ' s become quieter and a bit secretive . he locks himself in his room and i think he ' s running around with the wrong crowd .  Speaker1:  oh , i see . what makes you think that ?  Speaker2:  well , he ' s become friends with a couple of older boys who are in a band . and one night last weekend , he came home really late , way past his curfew . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  really ? what happened ?  Speaker2:  he told me that his friend ' s car broke down and they had to walk home . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  i see what you mean . i understand why you ' re concerned . have you tried talking to your son about it ?  Speaker2:  i haven ' t yet . i just keep hoping it ' s just a phase he ' s going through . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  you may be right , but it doesn ' t hurt to find out more about what ' s going on in his life .
 | 
Speaker1: look at this headline , soo mi .  Speaker2:  wow ! so many people in the united states get divorced !  Speaker1:  is it the same in korea ?

Speaker2:  not really . very few people get married beforethe age of 20 .  Speaker1:  hmm . do women usually work after they get married ?

Speaker2:  then , you should dress well .  Speaker1:  that ’ s right . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  i think a white shirt with a blue tie looks nice on you .  Speaker1:  you are smart . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  of course , the sports shoes don ’ t go with the formal occasions .  Speaker1:  you are right . what kind of shoes should i wear ?  Speaker2:  the brown leather shoes go well with your trousers . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  good idea . oh , by the way , would you please pick me up after the party , honey ?
 | 
Speaker1: so , how ' s your work ?  Speaker2:  good . how about you ? _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  i am going to resign . a few of the new staff have already left . obviously , a lot of similar jobs pay much better salaries .  Speaker2:  but your company is huge . can ' t they afford to pay the staff decent wages .  Speaker1:  but we have a policy of paying according to seniority in the company , so new employees get quite low salary , no matter how excellent they have done .  Speaker2:  that ' s shortsighted . by the time the workers are experienced and contributing . they are likely to go . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  that ' s why i am going to leave .  Speaker2:  but you have already worked there for five years .  Speaker1:  i am worried about my future . i can ' t believe that our company is as big as it is . the company can only continue to grow by taking care of its staff .

Speaker2:  now i see , you must be suffering from discomgoogolation .  Speaker1:  what does that mean ? there ' s nothing wrong with me .  Speaker2:  well , the term ' discomgoogolation ' comes from ' discombobulate ' and ' google ' . because floods of information are just a mouse click away , net users are very likely to become addicted to the web .  Speaker1:  that ' s alright . i just can ' t bear losing track of all the latest information . it almost drives me crazy .
 |

Speaker2:  it ' s beautiful 75 degrees . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  how nice . i hope the weather will stay like this for the whole week . i ' m going on the canoe trip this weekend .

Speaker1:  what a nuisance ! every time i plan to go canoeing or camping , a storm comes along . the sky gets dark , the wind starts to howl and the temperature drops . well , i ' d better stay home .

Speaker2:  really ? i thought the exhibition showed that he had real talent . what did you think of it ?  Speaker1:  i liked it . i didn ’ t think his works were masterpieces , but the certainly weren ’ t uninspiring , in my opinion .  Speaker2:  i don ’ t think i ’ ve ever read a good review of an exhibition by that critic . he doesn ’ t seem to like anything . which kinds of paintings do you prefer ? _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  i like landscapes and still life . you prefer abstract paintings , don ’ t you ?  Speaker2:  yes , i do . i like painters who use will rather than watercolors . the colors appear richer . what do you think ?  Speaker1:  i agree . i prefer oils too . i collect landscapes , but i only have a small collection . you have a small collection of abstract art , don ’ t you ?  Speaker2:  yes . good artwork is very expensive nowadays . when i was in china , i bought some calligraphy by famous artists . you should come and see it sometime .  Speaker1:  that would be nice . can you read the characters ?

Speaker1: office software like windows might be one of the best inventions in this information age . it saves us from so much work and makes the communication even around the world much easier .

Speaker1: millions of amateur investors like you , have to rely on a dizzying array of financial newspapers , magazines and commentators to get investment information .  Speaker2:  yes . it ' s sometimes scary if you think of the tremendous amount of media we face every day . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  it ' s like information overload , not to mention the reliability of these papers and magazines .  Speaker2:  which financial magazines and newspapers do you think do the best job of checking facts ?  Speaker1:  well , for example , the wall street journal is very , very good . even though it ' s used on occasion ( as all news organizations are ) by ces or bankers who leak their mergers in advance in order to get a positive spin . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  i like to read fortune .  Speaker1:  good . fortune is usually ahead of the curve . and business week is very solid , too . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  where does a broadcast company get most of their information ? i hope it ' s not just from press releases .  Speaker1:  a good broadcast company usually does far more than press releases . their people go out and do real reporting , talking to people at the stock exchange , fund managers , analysts , etc .

Speaker2:  well , i don ’ t want to be ripped like you ! i just want a good physique with weights and carpio .  Speaker1:  in that case you want to work with less weight . you can start off by working ten to fifteen reps in four sets . five kilo weights should be enough . now it ’ s very important that you stretch before pumping iron or you might pull a muscle .

Speaker1: what ' s the news on our website ? how effective do you think it is from a marketing standpoint ?  Speaker2:  we ' ve been able to survey and track some of the information of our website users through some cookie technology , and it ' s surprising to see the results .  Speaker1:  what kinds of hits are we getting on our company ' s website ?  Speaker2:  from the numbers , it seems nearly half of the visitors who stumble onto our page pick up the link not from network browsers or search engines , but from our circular insert . that means our consumers are purposefully and actively seeking information about our products and services through the web format . based on these findings , i am completely convinced the internet is the marketing power of the future !  Speaker1:  you really think that many people turn to the internet to find product information . what about the old standbys of word mouth and print media ?

Speaker2:  me , too . what did you have in mind ?  Speaker1:  i haven ' t decided yet , but i think the olympic mascots are a must .  Speaker2:  i agree . they ' re very lovely , especially huanhuan  Speaker1:  is that the red one ? that is my favorite , too . do you know how much they are ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  the five dolls are sold together as a set , and they ' re priced according to the size . the bigger they are the more expensive .  Speaker1:  oh , i see . if i buy more than a set , can i get any discount ?  Speaker2:  i don ' t think so . all the souvenirs of the olympic games are very hot right now .

Speaker1: how did you choose courses when you were abroad ?  Speaker2:  that ' s a very good question . choosing proper courses and effectively planning a college schedule is very important to the progress toward your educational goal . in order to do these wisely and effectively , you should consult with a program adviser or academic counselor . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  wait a minute . there are some new terms for me . i can hardly follow you .  Speaker2:  ok , i will go into more detail . a program adviser or an academic counselor is usually an experienced professor who is responsible for all the necessary academic counseling through graduation . you can discuss with him the program selection , changing or adding a program , the requirements for graduation , and other problems related to your study . you will choose some courses , and then discuss with the adviser whether your choice can meet the requirements for graduation . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  everything is so new to me . i think i ' ll have to experience a very difficult period when i get there .  Speaker2:  sure , very difficult . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  i am very grateful for your advice .

Speaker2:  not much . i ' m still living at home and commuting to school . i ended up dropping that metalworking class i was so excited about . it just wasn ' t as interesting as i ' d hoped . the guidance counselor suggested that i focus on my prerequisite courses so that i can make sure the credits count . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  that sounds smart . . . but kind of boring .  Speaker2:  yeah , it is , a little bit . i joined the great outdoors club , though , which has been a lot of fun . we ' ve gone on two camping trips already , and i ' ve made some good friends .  Speaker1:  that ' s cool . hey , so have you decided on your major yet ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  definitely pre - med . what about you ?

Speaker2:  i like thrillers and i like julia roberts , so it might be interesting . i read a review today and the critic didn ’ t seem to be very impressed .  Speaker1:  what did the critic say ?  Speaker2:  he didn ’ t say it was bad , but he said that it wasn ’ t as good as it could have been , particularly as there were some good actors and actresses in it . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  the movie starts at eight o ’ clock , so we have plenty of time to eat and get ready .

Speaker1: what are you doing ?  Speaker2:  what am i doing ? what am i doing ? don ’ t you know what day it is ?  Speaker1:  mumm . no .  Speaker2:  it ’ s only the day when the world ’ s biggest sporting event is kicking off .  Speaker1:  what ? _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  the world cup ! the first match is today ! it ’ s mexico vs . south africa ! it ’ s going to be a really good match ! both teams have a very strong offense and have skilled players . i think that south africa will probably dominate the first half since they are the host country , and all .  Speaker1:  i have no idea what you ’ re talking about . the only sporting event we watch at home is the super bowl .  Speaker2:  this is bigger than the super bowl , man ! teams from 32 countries compete against each other every four years and fight to win that trophy . they first start in a group stage with bigger groups , each group having 4 teams . the top 2 teams pass on to an elimination stage before going on to the quarter final sand semifinals .  Speaker1:  sounds interesting , but soccer doesn ’ t really appeal to me .  Speaker2:  are you kidding ? over seven hundred million people watched the final match of the world cup ! it ’ s a very exciting and nerve wracking sport ! each nation is cheering on their team , hoping they will become the next champion . so far brazil is the team with the most titles under their belt ; they ’ re really good !  Speaker1:  all i know about soccer is that you can ’ t use your hands and that players are always falling down , trying to get a free kick or penalty kick . it seems like a sissy sport to me !
 | 
Speaker1: you look so happy , anna . any good news ?  Speaker2:  yes . i ’ ve won the first prize in the math contest . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  really ? congratulations !

Speaker1: i am very interested in a new apartment near the taxing plaza , but the price is very high , i really can ' t afford it . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  how much is it for each square meter ? how large is the apartment ?  Speaker1:  it ' s 7500 yuan per square meter , and i really like the one with three bedrooms and a large living room . its total area is about 80 square meters . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  that surely will cost you a lot of money . are you going to make a full payment ?  Speaker1:  do you think i am rich enough to make it ? i am thinking about buying the apartment by installments . the real estate agency says if i pay a 25 % down payment , i can move in at once .

Speaker1: so , you friend ’ s getting married on saturday . what have you bought her as a wedding gift . i find is so hard to choose the right gift .  Speaker2:  my friend and her fiance had a really good idea . they have cut out pictures from catalogues and pasted them in a notebook . the picture are of things they want . people sign their name by the item they will buy .  Speaker1:  that ’ s clever ! then everyone knows that they are buying something the couple really want and there ’ s no chance of two people buying the same gift . what things were in the notebook ?  Speaker2:  most of the things were household appliance . you know , everything from an iron through a vacuum cleaner to a cooker . i think it ’ s an excellent way for everyone who knows the couple to help them set up home .  Speaker1:  so , what did you get them ?  Speaker2:  i bought a sewing machine . i know that my friend likes making her own clothes , but her current sewing machine is quite old and has some problems . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  what ’ s wrong with it ?  Speaker2:  she says that after several years of use , it ’ s not working properly . when she uses it , it makes a funny noise .  Speaker1:  household appliance don ’ t seem to last for a long time nowadays .

Speaker2:  the biggest city ? the biggest city is sydney , then it ' s followed by melbourne and then brisbane and then i think it ' s perth . but most of the big cities are on the east coast of australia . and perth is on the west coast , but sort of of out there by itself .  Speaker1:  ok . um , if you had to live in one place where would you live ?  Speaker2:  i like brisbane . i had my teenage years in brisbane , growing up in brisbane , um or maybe sidney because it is a big city , but brisbane has got the gold coast and the sunshine .  Speaker1:  oh , nice . actually , what is the capital city of australia ?

Speaker1: why are you shivering ?
 | 
Speaker1: what do you think of the way people use and treat animals ?  Speaker2:  i think most people treat animals well , but we are often cruel to animals . when we raise animals for food , the conditions they live in are often poor . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  perhaps people should stop eating animals . we could grow more crops .  Speaker2:  what would you do with all the animals ? you couldn ’ t just let them go . besides , some people would still hunt them . meat has become an integral part of our diet . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  we could provide them with better conditions anyway . we should certainly try to improve the conditions at zoos . we should try to recreate the natural conditions as much as possible .  Speaker2:  that ’ s true . i think zoo are a good idea , because they allow people to get close to animals . i think it ’ s good for kids to see wild animals .  Speaker1:  i agree . i ’ m an adult and i love going to the zoo . i don ’ t like animals experiments though . i believe that we can do tests in other ways . _sent_c99_label Speaker2:  i read that the number of animals being used in experiments is falling dramatically as new techniques are being introduced .  Speaker1:  that ’ s good news . the good thing is that most people treat their pets well .  Speaker2:  sometimes you read about people who have been cruel to pets or other animals , but those stories are rare . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  have you every given money to any of the charities that take care of animals .

Speaker1:  yes , i do . i find it very relaxing . i often listen to mozart or bach in the evening after a hard day at work .  Speaker2:  i must admit that i like several pieces of classical music . it ’ s certainly more sophisticated that modern dance music .  Speaker1:  classical music is supposed to be good for you brain . research suggest that it makes your brain more active . students who listen to classical music while studying perform better .

Speaker2:  she says a part - time job is cursed blessing . it takes so much time and energy that i won ’ t be able to focus on my studys . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  that may be true . but i ’ m sure you ’ re able to find a balance between them . why not try it ?  Speaker2:  i turned down quite a few offers before for her sake . but i ’ m a senior now , i don ’ t want to miss the chance this time .

Speaker1: television is undoubtedly a great invention , but one of the main criticisms of it is that people just aren ' t selective enough . lesley , got a television . how do you pick out the sorts ofprogrammes you want to watch ?  Speaker2:  i try and look at the programmes that are on to decide which particular ones interest me , rather than you turning it on a seven o ' clock and you leaving it on until half - past eleven when the programmes finish . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  do you think of television though as a great time - waster ?  Speaker2:  un . . . i think it can be a time - waster and it depends on how particular people are about what they want to see . . . mm , it can just be a sort total amusement for someone and totally consuming without reallyconsidering what it is they ' re watching . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  aha , but how do you prevent it coming into your life and taking oversour evenings and at the same time perhaps get . . . get out of thetelevision some of the sort of best things . . . best programmes that . . . that undoubtedly are on television ?  Speaker2:  well , i suppose one of the problems is . . . will depend on what a person ' s life style is , and that if he has other outside interests which are equally important to him as television , he will then , you know , hmm . be more careful about which programme she wants to watch because he has time which he wants to use for other things . _sent_c99_label Speaker1:  do you think though that . . . that in . . . in a sense television skilled people ' s own er . . . sort of , creativity or their ability entertain themselves because if they ' re bored all they do is justturn on the television ?
