i ’ d love to have my own farm . <sep> it would be very hard work . are you sure ? <sep> i wouldn ’ t mind getting up early morning and the physical work would make me fit and healthy . <sep> running a farm would be totally different to you current job . <sep> that ’ s one reason i ’ d like to try it . i ’ d really like to get away from working 9 to 5 in an office . <sep> you ’ d need a lot of training before becoming a farmer . it ’ s not something you can just walk into . <sep> my uncle owns a farm and i ’ ve spent some time working with him . i love being in the countryside with farm animals and green fields .
i think andy ' s party will be fun . <sep> yeah , i think so . oh , by the way , i need to ask you something . <sep> what ' s that ? <sep> could i get back the sweater you borrowed ? <sep> sure . oh , that reminds me . could i borrow your black leather boots ?

this small town has many serious problems . <sep> what ' s the cause ? <sep> the mayor and high officials practice cronyism and a large number of guys who are good at nothing occupy many important positions .

so what do you feel like doing this evening ? how about going to the cinema ? <sep> ah , that ' s a good idea . but i heard the film club of our school would show a film for free . maybe we don ' t need to go to the cinema . <sep> that ' s good ! i ' ve also heard there will be a party held by the students ' union tomorrow evening . would you like to go with me tomorrow night ? <sep> i ' d like to , but i ' m afraid i can ' t . <sep> why ? do you have to prepare for your examination ? oh , come on , girl , relaxation is also very important . <sep> that ' s not the reason . i have to go to the english corner tomorrow evening . you know , i ' ve been going there every week . <sep> oh , god , i ' ve forgotten it . <sep> you said you wanted to improve your english , so how about coming with me tomorrow ? i can also introduce some friends to you . <sep> oh , no , i don ' t want to know any more geeks like you . <sep> they are not geeks . they are also interested in singing , dancing , and so on . they are excellent , and they can always help me a lot . <sep> really ? is there a foreign teacher for every class ? <sep> it depends . if they are not busy , they will come to join us , and talk with us . <sep> so you just talk all the time ? <sep> of course not . the foreign teachers also teach us english songs , and play games with us . <sep> that sounds interesting . i ' ll go with you tomorrow evening .
have you ever found yourself in a situation when you have to lie to people who trust you ? <sep> do you mean lying to people for their good ? <sep> yes . is it wrong to lie to them even if it is for their good ? <sep> it ' s hard to say . i mean , how can you judge what ' s good for them ? maybe it is best to tell them the truth no matter what it is . <sep> but sometimes it is so hard to tell the truth .
it ’ s so relaxing , taking a walk in the country . the air is so fresh and clean . <sep> would you like to live in the country ? i ’ m not sure i ’ d like it . <sep> i can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage . the problem is that , for me , each advantage has its own disadvantage . <sep> what do you mean ? <sep> well , i hate the noise in the city , but i love being around lost of people . the problem is that you can ’ t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . the two just don ’ t go together . <sep> i see what you mean . i love being far away from a city , but i hate being so far away department stores and sports facilities . <sep> people can ’ t have it both ways . if you live in the country , it is often less convenient . if you live in a city , it is noisy , but there ’ s more to do . <sep> i would love to be surrounded by hills and streams . they ’ re so much better to look at than concrete , rows of parked cars and tall buildings . <sep> i would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face . when the wind blows in the city , you get dust in your mouth and in your eyes . <sep> the view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing . there ’ s so sign of pollution . the village looks so peaceful . <sep> just remember that in that village there ’ s nothing to do . there ’ s not even a pub or restaurant . there ’ s just one small shop with a poor selection of goods .

darling , i have news for you . bobby and his wife , evelyn , are going to have a baby soon . <sep> really ? i thought his wife couldn ’ t have a baby . <sep> actually they ’ re expecting the baby to come on my birthday . <sep> oh , what a coincidence ! i bet bobby must be very happy about it . he likes children and always wants a child of his own . <sep> in fact , they ’ re both very excited about the coming baby . evelyn imagines what their baby would be look like , since one parent is american and the other one is chinese . <sep> oh , right . now i know why they would want to see our boy . it ’ s hard to imagine the wonder ! are they expecting a boy or a girl ? <sep> it ’ s still a mystery . because evelyn is only three - month pregnant . but she begins to take her maternity leave now .

there is a tornado warning on . my mother just told me she heard it on the radio . <sep> what is a tornado warning ? <sep> it means that a tornado has been seen somewhere in the area . <sep> really ? in new berlin ? <sep> no . not necessarily in town . but in southern wisconsin somewhere . a tornado has been spotted . they have two stages here . this is what is called a " tornado watch . " that means that the weather conditions are perfect for a tornado . <sep> i understand . they think a tornado might come . <sep> yes . people should look out , because maybe there will be tornadoes coming . so it ' s called a " watch . " <sep> and the second stage is called a " tornado warning " . <sep> yes . if a tornado has been spotted , they announce a " tornado warning " . so if there ' s a tornado warning on , it means a tornado is out there somewhere . <sep> it ' s scary . <sep> well . tornadoes can be dangerous , it ' s true . if we hear something like a loud train coming , then we have to go in the basement . <sep> what do you mean " a loud train " ? <sep> that is what tornadoes sound like . they sound like trains . they ' re very loud . <sep> but if you hear them coming , isn ' t it already too late ? <sep> maybe . it depends on the tornado . some can move across the ground at 200 miles an hour . that is very fast . others aren ' t so fast . <sep> have you seen a lot of them ? <sep> i ' ve only seen one in my life . i was looking out the window . it was around two miles away . it was very interesting to watch . but it was heading toward my friend ' s house . so i quickly called them on the phone . <sep> did it hit their house ? <sep> no , it didn ' t . but they are glad i called them . <sep> what were they doing when you called ? <sep> they were all sitting in the living room watching tv . they had no idea a tornado was coming toward their house . if it had hit them , they could have all been killed .
oh , my god ! i ' ve been cheated ! <sep> what ? what did you buy ? <sep> it ' s a brick ! i can ' t believe how stupid i was . damn it ! <sep> what is it ? why did you buy a brick ? <sep> there was a guy on the sidewalk . he had three new boxes , panasonic video camera boxes . he said he had to get rid of them quick . <sep> and ? <sep> so he said he ' d sell me one for twenty dollars . a four - hundred - dollar camera for twenty bucks . <sep> and it ' s a brick ? <sep> yes . <sep> i can ' t believe how stupid you are . why didn ' t you open the box ? <sep> i wanted to . but he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store . if it ' s opened , other people won ' t believe it ' s new . <sep> so he had the boxes wrapped in plastic . <sep> yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products . look , it even had a bar - code price sticker on it ! it looked brand new . <sep> but why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ? <sep> he said he had to get rid of them . they were stolen . <sep> aha ! now i understand . you were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk . so , what i think is , you deserve to get cheated ! <sep> c ' mon , don ' t blame me ! i thought it was a new camera . we could use it . we were even thinking about buying a camera . i don ' t understand how he could have such a perfect - looking box .

i am going to celebrate my birthday with you all in a night club this year , what do you say ? <sep> fantastic ! i enjoy clubbing , especially those clubs with live bands . the only fly in the ointment is that the air is bad , full of smoke , and the music is too loud , so conversations are not really possible . once i nearly got burnt by a cigarette . <sep> how did that happen ?
it ' s a lovely day , isn ' t it ? <sep> yeah , and most excitingly , i met the girl living under me today . she ' s really nice . <sep> is she american ? <sep> yeah , and most importantly , she ' s single ! man , i could tell from the moment i saw her , she ' s the girl of my dreams ! <sep> so i take it you two are hitting it off ? i know it ' s very convenient to be in a relationship with your neighbor , but what if you break up ? <sep> i don ' t know . i am not really worried about that . i don ' t wanna lose before even starting . besides i think the other two american guys have also fallen for her . <sep> sounds like you ' ve got some competition . you made a move already ? <sep> not yet . but i am thinking of inviting her to dinner sometime . i know some good restaurants nearby . <sep> that ' s nice . having been here a little while surely gives you the advantage , eh ? <sep> you bet . now that you mentioned it , i think i ' ll call her now and see if she is available tonight . <sep> good luck !

how ' s your new job going ? <sep> really well , thanks . <sep> how are you finding your new boss ? <sep> she ' s not bad . she ' s a bit bossy , but i ' m sure i ' ll get used to her . <sep> would you rather have her or your old boss back ? <sep> she ' s far better than my old boss . he didn ' t know how to express his opinion without putting at least one other person down . <sep> how about your new co - workers ? <sep> they are all pretty easy - going . it ' s a very friendly place to work . <sep> do you miss your old co - workers ? <sep> of course . i spent so much time at my old workplace that i got to know them all very well . they were like family to me . <sep> do people in different departments get along with each other ? <sep> sure . since we work together in teams , we have to get along with each other . <sep> do you like working in teams with people from different departments ? <sep> yes , it helps everyone to understand what we ' re doing from different perspectives . <sep> do you like working in teams ?
what is the most unexpected thing you experienced in space ? <sep> i wasn ' t quite prepared for the view of the earth as we left . it was just awe - inspiring . it emerged from just a slightly curved horizon to a whole earth , where you could look across oceans and continents in a single glance . i wasn ' t quite prepared for that . it ' s inevitably etched in my memory . <sep> when viewing the earth from space , do you feel detached from humanity or more a part of the totality of humankind ? <sep> detached . you ' re literally detached from one planet , captured by another . your only link to reality is the earth out there ; fortunate - 1y , it stays in view the whole time . <sep> there ' re a lot of suspicions that the international space station is never going to become reality . is it going to be some future project that never happens ? <sep> i believe it ' s certainly for real . it without question has suffered a lot of delays . but there ' s hardware sitting on the pad right now and it ' s due to go off in december . it is a reality . it has just taken longer to get literally off the ground . <sep> there were a lot of talks during the bush administration about a not too distant future mars mission . it seemed to fizzle out . do you think that this shuttle mission will reignite the public ' s passion for space and get us to mars sooner ? <sep> i hope this flight is not just a one - time affair , that it does re - ignite people ' s interest to push on . but only time will tell . <sep> you had gone to the moon twice , orbited space around the earth lots of times , and of course you have had the most amazing views that a human being can have . how long do we ordinary beings have to wait to feel the weightlessness ? i just can ' t wait .
hey , look at the offer i got in my e - mail . it says that i can get rich quickly while working at home ! <sep> do you also believe in santa claus and the tooth fairy ? <sep> what do you mean ? <sep> i mean that you ' re gullible . you shouldn ' t believe everything you read , especially on the internet . <sep> but it seems like a good idea . all i have to do is first send some money to the person who sent me the letter . after that he ' ll tell me how to earn much more money . <sep> sounds like a pyramid scheme . have you heard of those before ? <sep> pyramid scheme ? what is that ? <sep> it ' s a scam 7 that ' s based on a hierarchy , like a pyramid . the person at the top asks the people below him for money , and then tells them to go and ask other people for money while sending some of it back to him . <sep> sounds good to me . the guy at the top gets money and so do the people below him . <sep> not exactly . the scam keeps on going , with the people at the bottom paying more and more money until they reach the very bottom . <sep> what happens then ?
hello , friendship restaurant . may i help you ? <sep> i ' d like to book a table tonight . <sep> yes , sir . for how many people , please ? <sep> eight . <sep> what time ? <sep> eight o ' clock tonight , would you please set us in a private room ? <sep> so sorry , we ' re fully booked in that room . would you like to make reservation some other time ?

if you go out recently you will find some people riding scooters in high streets and back lanes . <sep> yes . the german engineer would never dreamed that the hand - supported scooter he invented several years ago to solve his traffic problems would become so fashionable in the occident within a few years and even spread to japan and china . <sep> looking at the ' five sense organs ' of a scooter , it can be said as delicate and agile . to pull the t - shaped pole and make it vertical with the flat board and then pull it vertically , adjust its height suitable to you and you may use it .
finding an excuse is obviously down your alley . and trying to avoid taking care of the children is what you are good at . <sep> listen , nancy . if i don ' t work hard , i will be laid off . <sep> you are passing the buck . i ' ll be hanged if i ask you to go to the park with us .

alice , your father is amazing . he ’ s 90 years old and he lives alone in that big house . <sep> i know . he doesn ’ t like to ask anyone for help . my dad insists on paying his own bills and taking care of himself ! <sep> that sounds like my grandmother . she was always stubbornly independent . <sep> it seems that folks like my father and your grandmother are determined to be on their own . <sep> they see their independence as a kind of character strength .
guess what ! i know something you don ' t know ! <sep> what ' s that ? <sep> how many planets are there in the solar system ? <sep> that ' s easy . everyone knows that there are nine . <sep> not anymore ! can you believe it ? they ' ve decided that pluto is not a planet anymore ! <sep> nice try . i wasn ' t born yesterday , you know . <sep> i ' m dead serious . they ' ve decided that it ' s too small to be a planet , but actually they haven ' t yet agreed on how big something has to be in order to be a planet anymore . <sep> that sounds crazy . but they can ' t just change their mind about things like that . <sep> yes , they can . if you remember correctly , people used to believe that the world was flat . <sep> i suppose you ' re right . they also used to think that they were so important that the sun revolved around them , not the other way around . <sep> we actually know relatively little about space and the cosmos . <sep> do you think that we ' ll one day be able to travel to another planet for a vacation ? <sep> i suppose we could actually live on a planet outside of the milky way . <sep> do you think we ' ll ever get to meet an alien from outer space ? <sep> i hope not . i think they would be a threat to those of us that lived on the earth .

i ’ m trying to decide what school to apply for . <sep> are you thinking about a public school or a private one ? <sep> i ’ m not sure . what ’ s the difference between them ? <sep> public schools are usually state funded , whereas private schools usually get their funding elsewhere . <sep> which is better ? <sep> one isn ’ t necessarily better than the other . it depends a lot on the school administration and the teachers . <sep> i hear you have to wear uniforms at private schools .

now that you ' recommending such enormous fees , producers , directors , movie - makers must see you in a completely different light . <sep> yeah . <sep> then the standard that you set yourself originally must have changed . <sep> well , if that ' s the case , i don ' t mind breaking the image that they might have or the standards that they have . i can only do what i know , and live how i ' ve lived all my life , because i ' m a fairly stubborn person . <sep> it seems to me that now you ' re famous . you ' ve got to go out and be seen at the right places and go to the right parties . <sep> i don ' t go to parties . the parties i go to are the barbecues i have in my house . being seen in the right places is something that i don ' t believe in . i don ' t believe in going to events just for the sake i of being seen . <sep> then fans don ' t see you much in public places . <sep> yes . i have a very low - key life ; i have a great life . i love what i do and i love how i spend my time , which isn ' t in a public place . <sep> a lot of people compare you to julia roberts . i wondered if there was anyone that you compare yourself to in hollywood , that you ' ve watched and thought , ' well , they ' ve got something i could use a little bit or could learn a little bit about .

look at this headline - elvis baby born on spacecraft . where do these tabloids get such crazy stories ? <sep> i ’ ve often wondered the same thing . i also wonder who reads them . then i realize that i ’ m standing here reading them myself . <sep> it looks as though everyone in line reads them , or at least looks at the headlines . <sep> i think we picked the right line . this one seems to be moving more quickly than the others . <sep> maybe our checker is faster at scanning the food .
what ' s your favorite kind of music ? do you like pop music ? <sep> i like almost all kinds of music . but i like country music best . <sep> there was a concert country music last week . <sep> i wish i had been there ! <sep> i like it , too . but sometimes i enjoy jazz and classical music .
i feel confused by all the diet options out there . i don ’ t know which one actually works . <sep> most of them are not so practical . it will be very bad for your health if you skip lunches or supers as the recommended . i think making an exercise plan can be more effective . <sep> maybe you ’ re right . it is very expensive to go to a weight - loss center . i ’ d better join in a fitness club .

hurry up . time is running out .
is there a lot of crime in your city ? <sep> there ’ s some , but i don ’ t think it ’ s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime , burglary and car theft . there ’ s very little major crime . <sep> it ’ s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs . <sep> that happens in many places . in my city , there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . the police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes , but i don ’ t know if that ’ s the reason for our relatively low crime rate . <sep> some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .
why do all girls appear feminine after sophomore year ? <sep> because they are full - grown . look at their curvy figures . <sep> i feel they all talk and behave in a different way . <sep> they suddenly become shy when they speak to boys . <sep> some even do make - up slightly . are you aware that previous ' small potato ' ma xiaoxiao becomes a piece of cheese cake recently ? <sep> she is certainly not my kind of girl . <sep> stop preaching your dream love marilyn monroe to me . i know those sexy women are your tastes .

how do you usually get to school ? <sep> i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ? <sep> i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle , but when i feel lazy , i drive my car . <sep> i think we should discourage people from using their private cars . they produce too much pollution ! <sep> i agree , but i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it ' s just so convenient . <sep> cars might be convenient , but they ' re so bad for the environment . <sep> do you have a car ? <sep> no . i used to have one though . once i started using my bicycle to get around , i found that i didn ' t really need it . <sep> maybe if i sold my car now , i wouldn ' t be so tempted to use it . <sep> you could try . it would save you a lot of money . <sep> that ' s true . every month , i spend hundreds of dollars on gas , insurance , and repairs . <sep> if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving , you will get lots of exercise , too ! <sep> i could stand to lose a few pounds . having a car has made me lazy . i never end up walking anywhere !

what do you think are the main causes of war today ? <sep> i ’ d say the main reason is poverty . countries and their people get frustrated because they have so little . if their neighbors have some resources , they try to steal them by military force . <sep> it seems that a lot of wars nowadays are really civil wars . people from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country . <sep> several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . it seems they will never end . <sep> how do you think they could be ended ? <sep> i don ’ t think that there is any easy way . the united nations could send peacekeepers into the country . at least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . the thing is to find the real problem form the war and solve that . <sep> so , if the cause is poverty , there should be a program to make the country richer . if the problem is resources , share them . <sep> it sounds easy when you say it like that . in reality , it ’ s harder to make peace between countries . <sep> yes . it is . one way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . wars are very expensive .

i don ' t know why people are just mad about david peckham . is there really anything so fascinating with him ? <sep> he appeals to the fans thanks to two things <sep> you mean he plays well ? yeah , he often scores by free kicks in crucial games . but a football match is by no means merely a show of taking free kicks . <sep> certainly not . what really counts is to play as a team , passing the ball amongst each other , dodging defenders . free kicks are a result of all the teammates ' collective efforts . however , a few free k <sep> in the case , maybe facial charm should be his leading card . after all , the majority of his fans are girls .

i usually bowl with an eight ball . i like the control of a light ball . i can spin it more , so that the ball hooks . <sep> well . i like them a little heavier . i don ' t have as much control , usually bowling straight , but the extra momentum compensates for that . <sep> well , let ' s see which technique is better . i think i ' ll go up first . . . yes ! i hit a strike . i knocked them all down on my first bowl . <sep> well done . you got them all . you get 10 points and your next two bowls are added to this frame ' s score . i ' ii dry my ball off and try to knock them all down as well . <sep> good start . you knocked eight pins down . but you are left with a 7 , 10 split . unless you can bowl a ufo - ball on this bowl , it is going to be impossible .

hey , mike . you ' ve been surfing the net for quite a while . what on earth are you searching for ? <sep> it ' s something relative hackers . i often hear people talking about them , but i don ' t know much about them . <sep> well , roughly speaking , a hacker is a computer buff . <sep> you mean a guy using enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the computer ? <sep> you can say that . <sep> but why are people always having such a negative attitude towards them ? <sep> they must have mixed hackers with crackers . <sep> what is crackers then ? <sep> there is another group of people who loudly call themselves hackers , but they aren ' t . they break into computers and break the phone system . real hackers call these people crackers , and want nothing to do with them . <sep> so they are two totally different concepts . <sep> well , the real hackers mostly think crackers are lazy , irresponsible and not very bright , and feel that being able to break security does make you a hacker any more than being able to start cars without keys makes you an automotive engineer . unfortunately , many journalists and writers have been fooled into using the word hacker to describe crackers . this irritates real hackers to no end . <sep> i see . then the basic different is , hackers build things , crackers break them . <sep> you got it .

there are so many environment problems in the world today . do you think we can really solve them all or will destroy the world ? <sep> i hope that world leaders can get together and agree on a plan for action , but i doubt it ’ ll happen before it ’ s too late . <sep> we need to solve the problem of air pollution before we destroy the atmosphere . there ’ s lots of clean , modern technology , but companies in developed countries say it ’ s expensive . developing countries put more emphasis on economic development than on environment protection . <sep> everyone is looking at the issue in the short term , rather than the long term . it ’ s the same with the destruction of the rainforests . countries and companies just want the wood . they ’ re not thinking about the long - term damage to the forests . we should also remember that the forests are an important natural habitat for thousands of species of animal and plant life . <sep> in other parts of the world , especially in africa , there is a problem with desertification . climate change and over - farming are causing farmland to turn into desert . in means that people cannot grow enough food . <sep> it also means that people sometimes fight over the famp 3land that remains . damaging the environment actually leads to conflict between people . <sep> have you ever thought about joining an organization committed to protecting the environment ? you could get involved with projects to improve the environment .

welcome back ! how was your vacation ? <sep> it was fantastic , but i ' m glad to be back ! being a tourist is really tiring ! <sep> where did you end up going ? <sep> because it ' s off - season , we got a really good package deal to paris , so we went there . <sep> i ' ve always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! did you go to the top ? <sep> that was the first thing we did . i have a few pictures . do you want to see them ? <sep> sure . what ' s this one a picture of ? <sep> oh , that ' s a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . i ' m standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city . <sep> you don ' t look very happy in that picture . <sep> no , by that time , i was sick of sightseeing . i had had enough of art galleries , cathedrals , fountains , statues , and palaces ! <sep> so what did you do ? <sep> we spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . we had a few coffees , watched a movie , and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel . <sep> my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . did you go to the louvre ?
how was the party last night ? did you enjoy it ? <sep> oh , don ’ t talk to me about last night ! it was the most awful evening i ’ ve ever had . <sep> why ? what happened ? <sep> well . mary had promised to be my date , but she stood me up . i waited for her for a full hour in the cold wind . <sep> what about the party ? <sep> it was boring . the music was too slow and the food was lousy and , above all , i was really sick of the same old crowd all the time . <sep> so how long did you stay ?
harry is so down that he won ' t talk to anyone . <sep> i know only too well what that ' s like . <sep> what do you mean ?
now that it ’ s the new year , i ’ ve decided to turn over a new leaf . <sep> yeah ? you finally decided to wipe the slate clean ? <sep> you got it ! i have a new job , i ’ m living in a new city , with new friends ! this is my opportunity to make some small changes in the way i live my life . <sep> so what are you going to do ? take up an art class or something ? <sep> well , first of all , i ’ ve decided to stop smoking . it ’ s not that i ’ m pinching pennies or anything , it ’ s just that i ’ ve been smoking since i was sixteen , and i think it ’ s time to stop . <sep> i ’ m with you on that one . anything else you ’ re planning on doing ? <sep> one last thing , i ’ ve decided to come out of the closet .
when ’ re you getting married ? <sep> we planned our wedding for next may . <sep> why so late ? didn ’ t she want to get married this october ? <sep> yeah , i did . but my fiancee has an important project . <sep> that ’ s really a shame . by the way , who will be the bridesmaid ?

how do you think the transport system in our city could be improved ? <sep> i think that the public transport system could be made simpler . i never know where the bus routes actually go . the routes seem to twist and turn rather than going roughly in a straight line . <sep> i think we just need to build more roads . then there would be more space for cars to drive and we ’ d have fewer traffic jams . <sep> if we built more roads , people would just fill them with cars again . i think we should discourage people from using their cars . <sep> how would you do that ? <sep> i think we should do a few things at once . improving public transport would encourage people to use that . if we also charge people to use their cars in the city centre , they won ’ t use their cars as much . <sep> i don ’ t know . i think it ’ s unfair to make drivers pay more money . they already pay a lot of tax - petrol tax , for example . <sep> i think that they should pay more tax . look at the damage they cause to the environment and people ’ s health by discharging all those exhaust fumes . <sep> the air would certainly be cleaner if there were fewer cars being used in the city . the problem is that people will see it as reducing their freedom . it well be unpopular .

when it comes to select a fund , you will always read “ past performance is not an indication of future results ” , can you believe that ? <sep> maybe it is right since everything is possible . you know the market changes quickly these days . but i still have doubted those funds with bad stock performance . for me , his stock record is the very important criteria to decide which to buy . i really want to decrease the risk reach the minimum and achieve the maximum returns . <sep> but i still have doubted those funds with bad stock performance . for me , his stock record is the very important criteria to decide which to buy . i really want to decrease the risk reach the minimum and achieve the maximum returns .

my german teacher thought it would be a good idea to have german pen friends to write to in german . <sep> what a great idea ! now you have a friendly audience to practice with ! <sep> the only thing is that my pen friend will be writing in english . <sep> oh , he wants to practice his language skills , too . <sep> that ' s right . and it ' s a b that i ' ll be writing too . her name is olga . <sep> maybe olga can introduce you to some of her friends who can write to you in german and you can do the same for her with your friends to write her in english . <sep> that ' s a great idea ! why didn ' t i think of that ?

so who does he think he is , anyway , i can ' t believe the way that my boss has been ordering everyone around lately , i mean , it ' s now like he is the ceo , or anything . <sep> um . . . actually i am guessing you didn ' t get the memo . your boss was selected to fill the vacancy in the ceo slot . he actually is the ceo now , or will be , as soon as the official press releases and hoopla is done with . <sep> yikes ! you are joking , right ? i can ' t believe it . no wonder he is so stressed and bossy lately . i thought he was just being ostentatious by giving orders to people and all the different departments . what big shoes to fill ! <sep> no kidding ! when the last ceo left , we were worried about the future of the company . <sep> what does a ceo do anyway ? i know the ceo makes the most money in the company , but what does he actually do ?

ok , that ’ s fine . bye . <sep> what happened ? <sep> that ’ s it , my lease is up . i have to move . <sep> what ? why ? can ’ t you renew it ? <sep> the owner apparently is selling this place to make way for the construction of a parking lot <sep> well , i can help you pack . we should start looking for a new place for you asap . <sep> i think i might move in with my parents for a couple of months until i can find something . you know how hard it is to find a decent place around here . i ’ m gonna have to put most of my stuff in storage for a while . <sep> well , let me know if there ’ s anything i can do to help out . <sep> actually , would you mind looking after my pet tarantula and snake for a couple of weeks ?

there is a tornado warning on . my mother just told me she heard it on the radio . <sep> what is a tornado warning ? <sep> it means that a tornado has been seen somewhere in the area . <sep> really ? in new berlin ? <sep> no . not necessarily in town . but in southern wisconsin somewhere . a tornado has been spotted . they have two stages here . this is what is called a tornado watch . that means that the weather conditions are perfect for a tornado . <sep> i understand . they think a tornado might come . <sep> yes . people should look out , because maybe there will be tornadoes coming . so it ' s called a watch . <sep> and the second stage is called a tornado warning . <sep> yes . if a tornado has been spotted , they announce a tornado warning . so if there ' s a tornado warning on , it means a tornado is out there somewhere . <sep> it ' s scary . <sep> well . tornadoes can be dangerous , it ' s true . if we hear something like a loud train coming , then we have to go in the basement . <sep> what do you mean a loud train ? <sep> that is what tornadoes sound like . they sound like trains . they ' re very loud . <sep> but if you hear them coming , isn ' t it already too late ? <sep> maybe . it depends on the tornado . some can move across the ground at 200 miles an hour . that is very fast . others aren ' t so fast . <sep> have you seen a lot of them ? <sep> i ' ve only seen one in my life . i was looking out the window . it was around two miles away . it was very interesting to watch . but it was heading toward my friend ' s house . so i quickly called them on the phone . <sep> did it hit their house ? <sep> no , it didn ' t . but they are glad i called them . <sep> what were they doing when you called ? <sep> they were all sitting in the living room watching tv . they had no idea a tornado was coming toward their house . if it had hit them , they could have all been killed .

what did you do over the weekend ? <sep> i went a global warming rally . it was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment . <sep> do you think there ' s anything we can do to reverse the damage that ' s been done already ? <sep> it might not be possible to fix the problems that we ' ve created for ourselves , but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening . <sep> like what ? <sep> well , we can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start . <sep> what else can we do to protect the environment ? <sep> if you do have to drive , you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . also , your home should use sources of renewable energy . <sep> how about recycling ? does that actually help ? <sep> yes . you should take your glass , paper , plastic , cardboard , and tin cans to a recycling center . <sep> what do you think the biggest worry for our future is ? <sep> i think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone . <sep> i had no idea you were such an environmentalist before !
my boss wore a real stupid tie to work today . can you guess why ? <sep> he isn ' t a man of good taste for clothes , is he ? <sep> he is , but i didn ' t mean that . his daughter bought him a tie as a father ' s day gift , and he was very happy to wear it and show it off to us in the office . <sep> it must be hard being a father . <sep> no , it ' s great being a father , seeing your children growing up and loving you and admiring you .

who is your favorite nba star ? <sep> kobe bryant , of course . <sep> kobe ? i know him , the key guy of the lakers , a heck of a nba player . he is on fire when he breaks through enemy defense . <sep> he is competent both in driving the lane and shooting jumpers , but what really makes him formidable is his ability to switch up and dribble with his left hand . <sep> maybe he is not good at rebounding ? <sep> indeed , no man can be perfect . he is just so - so in crashing the boards . usually he plays shooting guard . rebounding might not be his strong suit . <sep> kobe came to beijing during this summer ' s olympics . did you go to the match between china and usa ? <sep> who wouldn ' t ! my friend lee went so far as to get an autograph from him . <sep> well then , what are your spoils ?

what upsets you ? <sep> my parents called . as usual , they reminded me again that i should have a plan to marry by my late 20s . easier said then done . who should i marry ? i have no time to go on a date . <sep> it is not your mother finding one for you ? <sep> i will find one myself , of course . i ’ m a modern girl . <sep> perhaps you can try the three minutes date , the latest type . <sep> you mean dozens of the opposite sex meet each other for three minutes in a dimly bar serving alcohol , i hate that idea . <sep> no , there is an updated virgin , three minutes video date . i know an online dating website providing such service with a microphone and webcam , you can sigh for it . you can be face - to - face with a guy talking for maximum three minutes . <sep> i don ’ t think it makes sense . three minutes is such a short time . <sep> i think you can find out if there is a possibility of romance within the first second of meeting someone , so - called love at first sight . <sep> anyway , i don ’ t want to post my face up for sale on the internet like that . <sep> don ’ t worry . there are many other options using the internet as dating methods . some sites operate at international standard even have got certifications . of course , for these sites , you have to pay a membership fee . but all in all , it is more serious and professional . the chance of meeting a good and serious person who does not play games is higher .

what are you reading ? <sep> it ’ s an article about language . it talks about the idea of having a single global language . <sep> it seems that english already is the main global language . does the article suggest that there should be an artificial language like esperanto as the world language . <sep> actually , it suggest english . the main argument is that english is already being studied as a second language in most countries - china , india , mexico , nigeria , pakistan , and japan . so beginning again with a language like esperanto would be wasteful . the second argument is that english is used in modern technology far more that any other language . most emails are sent in english and the vast majority of website use english . <sep> does the article say anything about other language ? how will they survive in an english - speaking world ? <sep> the article points out that many languages have been lost and will be lost , but others will continue to be used for generation , even if english continues to be the dominant language . <sep> right . all the people who speak chinese . hindi , french and spanish aren ’ t suddenly going to stop using those languages .

you must like negotiating a lot . people are saying , you are a super negotiator . <sep> ha , i am flattered . actually , when it comes to negotiate , you don ’ t need to like it . you just need to understand how it works . <sep> i am not good at it by any means . give me some advice . <sep> well , generally speaking , if you want to change someone ’ s mind or understand his position , you have to put yourself in his shoes . understand his need and the cost for his need . and then you work together to find a solution . <sep> sounds easy . but how can i apply to practice ? i am thinking about applying for more reimbursement for my mobile bill . but i am afraid our boss will turn me down .

look , forest gump is on at six thirty . <sep> really ? it was on in 1994 for the first time . and it is really a classic . <sep> yeah , i am very impressed with tom hanks ' performance in the movie . <sep> i am also impressed with the lines in the movie . <sep> life is like a box of chocolates , you never know what you ' re gonna get . <sep> that ' s my favorite . <sep> you know , it also won 6 oscar awards in 1995 . unbelievable ! <sep> it deserves . that film can give us a lot of inspiration . <sep> yes , the forrest ' s experience can encourage the people in trouble . <sep> all in all , it will never lose its appeal . <sep> gucci , i have an idea . do you want to see this movie together ?
i think that show biz stars have a really easy life . they have lots of money , so they can buy almost anything they want . they ’ re famous , so everyone loves them . <sep> i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . they must get sick of it . <sep> i bet they love it really . sure , they complain about it , but that just gets them more publicity , doesn ’ t it ? <sep> i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . they only want it for their films . <sep> no way ! they want publicity for themselves , so that they get invited to make more films , go to lots of cocktail parties , and even make albums ! they have such an easy life . they don ’ t even pay for drinks when they go to a cocktail party . <sep> show biz stars have plenty of expenses . that ’ s why they need so much money . they need million of dollars to buy big , seclude houses and wonderful dresses . i bet most show biz stars would prefer to wear jeans and a t - shirt , but they can ’ t because their managers force them to wear clothes they don ’ t like . <sep> i don ’ t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . they ’ re overpaid , over - ambitious , and over - adored .

did you hear ? the state is thinking of legalizing gambling in our city ! soon we are gonna have amazing hotels and casinos here which will be good for our business ! <sep> are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the intentional exploitation of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! it disgusts me . <sep> what are you talking about ? how does it exploit people ? <sep> well , to begin with , gambling is addictive , ruins marriages , destroys families and bankrupts communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses , cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . secondly , it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . women gamble to escape , and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction . underage gamblers often start gambling on sports with friends and then illegal bookies . <sep> geez ! now that i think about it , maybe legalizing gambling isn ’ t such a good idea ! although , i have been to las vegas , and i didn ’ t become addicted or anything like that .

hi mary , how ' s it going ? <sep> well , last night i had a big argument with ann . <sep> terrible . it must be something serious . you two are such close friends . <sep> now that i look back at it , it wasn ' t that big a deal . i shouldn ' t have lost my temper . <sep> really ? what happened ? <sep> it ' s just we ' ve been planning to go the beach for a while , and we decided we could both make it this weekend . then out of nowhere she called me up , said her boyfriend had made plans and that she need to cancel the trip . i was so angry when she told me that i said she didn ' t care about our friendship at all . <sep> that ' s pretty harsh . <sep> i know , but i was so upset . i mean , come on ! does she have to do everything her boyfriend says ? <sep> you know she probably feels just as bad . <sep> well , i think i was being a little selfish myself . i know they don ' t get to see each other very often . <sep> well , in that case i guess maybe you can be more understanding . you shouldn ' t let a trivial thing like this stand in the way of your friendship . after all you can go to the beach anytime you want .

hello , joanna . you are looking very charming in the new dress . <sep> thanks . does it suit me ? <sep> yes , it suits you very well . it certainly is unique . i don ’ t think i ’ ve seen anything like it before . <sep> i know . that ’ s why i bought it . i hate wearing the same styles like everybody else is wearing . <sep> and the necklace , it matches your dress marvelously .
hi , tina , it ' s joe . <sep> hi , joe . <sep> what ' s the weather like there today ? <sep> it ' s really cold . it snowed all day and the school closed early . <sep> what ' s the temperature ? <sep> it ' s 20 degrees below zero now . it was even colder this morning . <sep> have you heard what the weather is going to be like tomorrow ? <sep> i was watching the news a little earlier . they said it ' s probably going to snow tomorrow . <sep> i really don ' t like the winter . i wish it were summer .

ben cancelled his trip . <sep> how come ? <sep> because general , his dog , got sick .
which social problem do you think the government needs to concentrate on most ? <sep> i think housing is a big problem . there are thousands of homeless people on the streets . <sep> how would you solve the problem ? <sep> i have a good idea to solve it . the government could provide some money for homeless people to build their own homes . <sep> it would probably be very expensive . <sep> i think the government can afford it . besides , there are many advantages . homeless people would find it easier to get jobs if they had an address . they would learn some useful skill for finding jobs i <sep> it ’ s not a bad idea . i think education is the biggest problem at the moment . schools don ’ t seem to have enough money to educate kids properly . <sep> if we are to invest more money to education , we will need to raise taxes . that wouldn ’ t be popular with voters . <sep> most voters what everything both ways . they want the government to pay for lots of things , but without increasing taxes .
come back . you haven ' t paid yet . <sep> may , just let him go . <sep> but he took some newspaper away without paying . <sep> i know . <sep> why ? you make me confused . <sep> he lives nearby and he would just glance at the newspaper headlines , read the political sections and return them later . <sep> why does he have such a privilege ? <sep> he used to be a hero during the war time and everyone respect him . <sep> i see . does he live by himself ? <sep> yes , he has no children and his wife passed away when he was in the battle . <sep> he must be lonely ?

han maimed , what ' s your plan for the weekend ? <sep> i plan to travel around harvard university and know more about it . to tell you the truth , i plan to apply for harvard after graduation from high school . it ’ s better to get to know it . what about you ? <sep> i get together with my christian brothers on saturdays . <sep> oh , my god ! john , i didn ’ t know you are religious . you just look like a scientific kook , like leonard in the big bang theory . <sep> come on , han maimed , don ’ t make a fuss . a lot of americans , including many scientists , believe in religion . <sep> but i ’ m really surprised . i thought science and religion are not compatible , are they ? <sep> yes , they are compatible . actually , the u . s . is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world . <sep> i ' ve heard about it a little bit before , but i don ’ t understand . how can people believe in god since they know god doesn ' t exist ? <sep> that ’ s a little complicated . you ’ ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the u . s . history later on . religion was and is a part of american people ’ s life . guess what ? even harvard university , which is a highly academic institution , is in a sense the product of religion . <sep> really ? <sep> absolutely ! it was founded by a group of puritan immigrants from england . <sep> why was it founded by the puritans ? where were the atheistic educators ? <sep> because most of the first english immigrants who came to the united states were puritans . <sep> how come ? i mean why most of them were religious people ? <sep> that ’ s because in the 16th and 17th century , there was a series of religious reforms in england . many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries . <sep> so , you mean people didn ' t enjoy religious freedom in england ? <sep> yes , that ' s why puritans moved to the new world , where they believed they could establish a heaven for puritans . later on , it was these puritans who founded harvard college . <sep> why did they want to found a college ? <sep> many puritans had received classic style of higher education in oxford university and cambridge university back in england . they hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well . <sep> oh , i see . <sep> actually harvard was first named ' new college ' , without a formal name . <sep> when did it begin to be called harvard university ? <sep> in 1639 , it was renamed after its major benefactor john harvard . interestingly , johnharvard himself was a clergyman . <sep> it seems that harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion . <sep> therefore , it ’ s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion , there would note harvard . <sep> wow , i didn ’ t know that religion had played such an important role in harvard history . <sep> religion has been playing an indispensible part in harvard history as well as the u . s . <sep> i finally begin to get to know harvard . it seems that my knowledge of harvard is rather poor . i have a lot work to do before applying for harvard . <sep> remember that harvard is a part of the united states . so you have to know the u . s . history and culture if you want to have in - depth knowledge of harvard . the two are closely related .
you mustn ' t touch the wet paint , bill . <sep> i ' m sorry . i won ' t do it again . <sep> try to be more careful in future . <sep> i shall . i wasn ' t as careless as john sampson . he walked across that wet cement over there . <sep> the workmen oughtn ' t to leave it without a no tice . <sep> the headmaster asked them not to do so . <sep> then why isn ' t there a notice ?
if he promised to help you , i ' m sure he will help . he ' s a man of his word .
did you hear about car accident on spring road yesterday ? <sep> yes , i did . i heard that they took both drivers to hospital . one needed surgery . <sep> yes . i heard he had a few broken bones too , but that the doctors have set the fractures without any problems . <sep> the second driver was luckier . he had a concussion and needed some stitches for his head wound . <sep> yes . he was released from hospital yesterday evening . the other man could be there for weeks . <sep> i understand that he ’ s connected to a heart monitor and breathing apparatus . his condition can ’ t be very good . <sep> the hospital announced this morning that his condition is poor but stable . what does that mean ?
what do you think of the speech the man delivered just now ?
you ’ re going to set up your own law office , aren ’ t you ? <sep> yes . after so many years of hard work , i ’ d rather i had an office of my own . <sep> if you need help , don ’ t hesitate to ask me . <sep> i ’ ll be very glad if you would help . <sep> i ’ d like to wish you every success in your new venture .

would you like to come over for dinner tonight ? <sep> sure , but i have to tell you that i ' ve become a vegetarian . i don ' t eat any kind of meat . <sep> when did you decide to become a vegetarian ? <sep> i saw a program a few months ago about how animals are raised for human consumption . i haven ' t been able to eat a single piece of meat since . <sep> that ' s great . do you find that you eat a lot more fruit and vegetables now ? <sep> definitely . i ' ve also been buying organic fruit and vegetables , which is more expensive , but much better for you because they don ' t have any pesticides on them . <sep> you ' ve really turned into a health nut , haven ' t you ? <sep> i guess you could say that . eating fruit and vegetables helps keep you healthy . i ' ve lost 5 pounds and i feel great ! <sep> how do you get enough protein in your diet ? <sep> well , i eat a lot more tofu , beans , nuts and some fish . <sep> well , don ' t worry about dinner . i ' ll only make vegetarian dishes for you . do you like sushi ? <sep> i prefer cooked fish to raw fish , but if you really like it , make it . <sep> how about a spicy tofu and vegetable stir - fry ? <sep> that sounds great . what time should i come over ? <sep> dinner will be ready at about 7 : 30 pm , so you can come over at 7 p . m .

what do you think is harder , reading or writing ? <sep> well , they ’ re completely different . reading is passive , and writing is active . <sep> i don ’ t think i understand what you mean . could you explain a little more ? <sep> in reading you need to recognize language by seeing the words on the page and knowing what they are . in writing you have to produce language , you have to create your own words on a blank page . <sep> oh , now i see what you mean . when you ’ re reading , you are just looking , but when you are writing , you are actually doing something ! <sep> a reading knowledge of a language is larger and different from a writing knowledge . don ’ t you think so ? <sep> i think i see what you mean . i can read shakespeare but i definitely can ’ t write it . <sep> exactly . <sep> so i have another question for you . what do you think is harder , speaking or understanding ? <sep> they ’ re both harder than reading or writing . <sep> in what way ? <sep> because they are direct communication with another person , and there ’ s a time limit . this time limit is the most serious problem for foreigners , even for those who know lots of english . <sep> you are making me feel really discouraged .
hello ! <sep> oh , hi ! <sep> please allow me to introduce myself . my name is tom . <sep> pleased to meet you . my name is alice . did you just move in next door ? <sep> yes , i did . have you lived here long ? <sep> me ? i guess so . i ' ve lived here for about six years now . have you lived in america very long ? <sep> no , not really . when i left vietnam , i came to america and i lived with a cousin in dallas for two years . where do you work , alice ? <sep> i teach mathematics at a college . what do you do ? <sep> i am an accountant at a company . <sep> well , tom . it ' s good to meet you . i have to go now . i am teaching a class this evening , and i need to get to the college . <sep> it ' s nice meeting you too , alice .

i am kind of nervous . <sep> nervous ? why ? <sep> i don ' t know . i never went to a church before . i was not raised as a christian , so i don ' t know what to do . <sep> don ' t worry . you don ' t have to do anything . all you have to do is listen . you will enjoy it . <sep> maybe . i know i agreed to go with you , but now i don ' t feel right about it . <sep> listen , ryan . catholics welcome people who aren ' t catholics to visit the church . you don ' t have to pretend to be catholic . it ' s okay if you just come to listen . <sep> really ? <sep> yes . we are kind and welcoming people . it is not a secret society or something like that . <sep> alright . but will we sing ? <sep> yes , but you don ' t even have to sing . if you want to sing along , you can . <sep> i don ' t know the words . <sep> there is a songbook . all the words are in the songbook . many people have to read the words . <sep> and will i go up to the front to have the bread and wine ? <sep> no . that is something only true catholics do . so if you come to the church as a visitor , you only listen to the service . but you shouldn ' t go up to the altar for the bread and wine . only after someone joins the church , then they go up for the eucharist . <sep> eu - char - ist ? what is that ? <sep> that is the special word for the ritual of the bread and wine . the catholics call it the eucharist . <sep> it doesn ' t sound like an english word . <sep> it ' s not . it ' s an ancient greek word . it means gratitude . <sep> alright . well , i feel more comfortable now . now i understand i am welcome as a visitor .
say , anna , what are you doing tonight ? would you like to go out ? <sep> oh , sorry , i can ' t . i ' m going to work late tonight . i have to finish this report . <sep> well , how about tomorrow night ? are you doing anything then ? <sep> no , i ' m not . what are you planning to do ? <sep> i ' m going to see a musical . would you like to come ?

so it looks like we start selling in the u . s . next year . <sep> did mr . lin put you in charge of marketing ? <sep> he ' s still not sure whether he wants to put me in charge , or whether he wants to hire an american . but even if he hires an american , i ' ll probably be transferred to our american office . <sep> where will it be ? <sep> we aren ' t sure yet . maybe l . a . i think l . a . would be the best idea . <sep> is it because of trade negotiations that we can start selling in the u . s . ? <sep> yes , the recent agreements between the two governments have changed everything . now we have the right to sell in america at a much lower tariff . it ' s going to be good . we can compete more directly with them . <sep> great . <sep> our computers have a high level of quality now . we can demonstrate it . and our prices will be good . so i think it will really be worthwhile . <sep> you seem excited about it . <sep> well , you know i studied marketing in america . so maybe the thought of going back there to promote our brand is kind of exciting to me . i ' d love to be part of the team . <sep> do you honestly think we can compete though ? all the computer giants are there . <sep> yes , i do . i think we can compete . i think we can make a name for ourselves . it will be hard at first . but if we develop a good advertising campaign , i think we can break into the market . <sep> the company will have to choose a good advertising firm . and then there ' s the problem of quality . how do we convince american buyers that our quality is good ? <sep> it takes some time . because even if the quality is high , people won ' t accept a high tech product unless they recognize the name . name recognition is crucial . <sep> well , i hope it all works out , john . i think if you ' re part of the team , things will go well . but you know we ' d all miss you here . so i won ' t say i ' m happy to think that you ' re leaving . <sep> that ' s very nice of you to say . but if we set up an office there in the states , maybe you could try to become part of it .

earning extra income on the internet is easier than you might think . after i started selling traditional craft items on the internet last year , i have really been able to make bank doing something i love . <sep> is that right ? i hear all these horror stories of internet business crashing because there is not enough of a customer base yet . how can you be sure your idea will cash in ? <sep> to run a successful internet business , it requires a little research and relatively small investment . you ' ve got to have a good idea of some kind of product that is in demand or would be popular . <sep> that ' s marketing research . . . but what about getting started once you have an idea ? <sep> after you have your great idea , then you can set up shop by registering a domain name , creating a website , an email address , and a hosting service . if you want to go all out on your website , you can put together shopping cart technology , but that can be pricey to start out with .

are there any interesting articles in today ’ s newspapers ? <sep> the headlines are all about the presidential election in the united states . few other stories made the front pages . <sep> is there anything of interest to us in the business sections ? <sep> there ’ s an interesting feature article in the chronicle about doing business in china and the daily news has printed a report about the special economic zone near pairs . we have a subsidiary company l <sep> are the reports favorable ? <sep> generally , the reporters take positive lines . they do point out a few problems that we need to be aware of , but there ’ s nothing worrying in the reports . in the classifieds , one of our competitors is a <sep> that ’ s interesting . they must be thinking of moving into that market . are there any interesting editorials ? <sep> not really . they all seem to focus on the election . there have been several letters printed in the chronicle regarding that controversial article on drugs that they printed last week . <sep> i ’ m not surprised . that article certainly added fuel to the debate . ok . thanks . can you leave two articles and the advertisements with me ? i ’ d like to read them .

so , how should we go to the theatre ? <sep> let ' s take the bus . <sep> i hate the bus system in london ! the bus drivers are rude , the buses are never on time , and there are few people around who can help you . <sep> it ' s not that bad . you probably just had a bad experience once . <sep> it wasn ' t just once . every single time i take the bus , something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus . <sep> we could take the subway , but we ' d have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice . <sep> train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare , too . <sep> if we don ' t hurry up , we ' ll miss the show . should we take the bus ? <sep> we ' re already late , so i think we had better take a taxi . <sep> i don ' t think we ' ll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours . let ' s just take the bus . <sep> fine . have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives . <sep> it looks like it should be here in just a few minutes . <sep> don ' t worry . nothing bad will happen . i ' ll even buy your ticket for you .
so you ' re traveling around the world , aren ' t you . <sep> that ' s right <sep> when did you arrive here ? <sep> last night <sep> did you have a good journey ? <sep> yes , i enjoyed it very much . <sep> where have you been on this trip ? <sep> let me see . ah , yes , i ' ve been to england , france , germany , italy and now i ' ve been in spain <sep> really ? how long will your holiday last ? <sep> two weeks <sep> all these countries in two weeks ?

so chris , i ' ve heard that you ' re from a big family . how many people ? <sep> nine total . seven children and my parents . <sep> seven children ? that ' s a lot . why did your parents have so many ? <sep> well , my mother came from a big family , and wanted to have one of her own . my father was an only child , and didn ' t really care about having a large family , but my mother talked him into it . <sep> jeez , seven children . that must have a lot of problems . we have four children in my family and my grandparents can never get our names right . <sep> it can be hard , and there are certain sacrifices you have to make . <sep> like what ? i assume that there ' s no privacy . <sep> that ' s one . another is the lack of personal property . everything you have , from toys to clothes , is used by your brothers and sisters . especially clothes . three quarters of my wardrobe are hand - me - downs . <sep> and the age gap is also annoying . there ' s a ten - year difference between my younger brother and me . we have nothing in common . <sep> same problem here . there ' s an 18 - year gap between the oldest and youngest child in my family . the last child was born just as the oldest was going to college . <sep> well , at least going to college won ' t be too bad . since both of your parents are college professors , they must give you reduced tuition at the college .
i am having a hard time at my job . <sep> what ' s wrong , julia ? <sep> my colleagues quickly get promotions , while i always get sidelined . i don ' t know what to do anymore . <sep> don ' t give up so soon . <sep> but i don ' t know what else i can do . i am willing to work hard . sometimes i make mistakes and the boss is not happy . <sep> mistakes are just a lessons to learn from . <sep> tell that to my boss . <sep> do you know abraham lincoln ? <sep> yes . <sep> he grew up poor in kentucky and barely had a year of schooling , but he went on to become the president of united states . <sep> he was also assassinated because of his views . <sep> he is known as american ' s greatest president . do you know why ? because he fought against slavery and secession at a time in history where others were too afraid to do anything . he succeeded because of his ambition and generous spirit . <sep> well , if he can become president , then i can at least get a promotion .
how about a movie on sunday , mum ? <sep> well , i ' m afraid your father ' s not interested in modern films . <sep> we could find a classical one .
pardon me . could you please pass me the tissue ? <sep> sure , here you are . <sep> thanks , i didn ' t expect the dish to be so spicy . are you ok ? <sep> yeah , i think the food is alright , it ' s not too spicy though it ' s a little salty for me . but you are chinese , you should have known better . <sep> well , not every chinese can handle spicy food in the way people from sichuan and guizhou provinces can . back where i come from , people don ' t eat a lot of papers and chilies . <sep> oh , i see how this food can be really hard for you . i can sympathize with that . i stayed in sichuan for a year . the food was difficult at the beginning . every dish was so spicy . after a while though , i got used to the taste , and now i won ' t consider anything a real dish if it isn ' t spicy . <sep> yeah , you can increase you tolerance for spicy food , but so far , i haven ' t had the need or the opportunity . every time i try spicy food , it is a total disaster for my nose and eyes . <sep> i completely understand . i didn ' t intend on liking spicy food at first either , but when you have no other choices , you ' ve got to adapt . <sep> yeah , i guess that ' s a typical example of ' when in rome , do as the romans do . '
it is difficult for old people to do away with old ideas . <sep> so the reform cannot be carried out well . <sep> government is making efforts to change situation .
bob ! your eyes look bloodshot . did you not sleep well ? <sep> i had a drop too much last night . i attended a banquet given by a chinese colleague of mine . and it was startling for me to find that people are forced to drink against their will on a chinese table . <sep> you have it right . alcohol is a medium for communicating emotion in china . drinking with business partners or would - be friends is a way of solidifying friendship , especially in northern china . <sep> i just felt embarrassed if i refused to drink when people toasted to me . but if i keep gulping down one cup after another , i ' m afraid i would feel unfit or sick . <sep> you lose face by refusing to drink , and the host might think you refuse to give him face . the right thing to do seems to be drinking yourself into incoherence until you throw up . this will endear you <sep> a few guys even threw a drunken fit last night , crying hoarsely and bawling whole heaps of nonsense that i never understood . <sep> then he must be opening his heart to the friends . in a word , as long as you demonstrate a readiness to drink more in spite of already suffering extreme discomfort , no one will jeer at you .

we ’ ve been over this a thousand times . the data is irrefutable ! look , we ’ ve done extensive research , built studies , and read the literature , and there is conclusive evidence to support my theory ! <sep> horowitz , i beg to differ . even in your most recent study , the investigative approach was flawed ! you know as well as i do that the collection of data was not systematic , and there is a large margin of error . to draw a definitive conclusion based on that data would be misleading <sep> that is preposterous ! <sep> you are trying to single - handedly solve one of the world ’ s greatest mysteries , and yet you are oblivious to the fact that you are wrong ! <sep> i am not wrong ! the chicken came first !

how do you usually get to school ? <sep> i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ? <sep> i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle , but when i feel lazy , i drive my car . <sep> i think we should discourage people from using their private cars . they produce too much pollution ! <sep> i agree , but i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it ' s just so convenient . <sep> cars might be convenient , but they ' re so bad for the environment . <sep> do you have a car ? <sep> no . i used to have one though . once i started using my bicycle to get around , i found that i didn ' t really need it . <sep> maybe if i sold my car now , i wouldn ' t be so tempted to use it . <sep> you could try . it would save you a lot of money . <sep> that ' s true . every month , i spend hundreds of dollars on gas , insurance , and repairs . <sep> if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving , you will get lots of exercise , too ! <sep> i could stand to lose a few pounds . having a car has made me lazy . i never end up walking anywhere !
did you see the way that brian came to work yesterday ? ever since he came back from that conference in silicon valley , he ' s been coming to work dressed in jeans and sweatshirts . it ' s like he ' s decided to make himself at home in his office . i don ' t know how long it ' ll take before the management talks to him about it . <sep> he was really influenced by the way they do things on the west coast . i guess the working atmosphere is a lot more relaxed and casual in california . it comes from the information technology industry . . there isn ' t such a large division between home and office , so people want to work in the clothes they feel more relaxed in . <sep> maybe so , but it seems kind of strange , which the rest of us in white shirts , dark suites , and ties . <sep> it ' s not as bad as that . . . we are allowed to wear more casual jackets and trousers . besides , didn ' t you hear what brian found on his desk this morning ? <sep> what ' s that ?

hey , that ' s a really nice outfit you have on . <sep> why , thank you . i wasn ' t sure if it looked okay or not . i can ' t believe all the words the salesgirl said . <sep> oh , you look stunning . your dress really goes well with your shoes . <sep> i ' m glad that you think so . i thought it might be a bit too revealing . <sep> no , not at all . it looks really classy on you . where did you pick that up ? <sep> i got it on sale down at the department store . <sep> when did you go there ? <sep> i was just there a couple of days ago . you know , you should go down there too . they have a lot of stylish clothes on sale . <sep> i might just do that . what style of clothes do they have ? <sep> anything you want . they have both casual and formal styles . <sep> i was hoping to get a few new ties for my collection . <sep> that ' s a good idea . some of your ties are pretty outdated . <sep> well , i spent a lot of money on getting my shirts tailor - made , so i couldn ' t afford to buy any new ties . <sep> anyways , are you going to the party tonight ? <sep> yes , i am . say , are you going to wear that outfit to the party ? <sep> i don ' t think so . it is a little too formal . i ' m probably going to wear something more laid back . <sep> me too . i will probably go dressed in a t - shirt and jeans . <sep> i guess that you will really be dressing down . <sep> that ' s my style when i ' m not in the office .
hello , jim . what was the film like ? <sep> awful . it was a complete waste of time . <sep> why ? what was it about ? <sep> it was about a married couple . they had to live with the wife ' s mother , because they didn ' t have enough money to buy a house of their own . <sep> a lot of young people have to do that . <sep> yes . but the husband had to work overtime three times a week , so he was always tired . <sep> lt sounds like the story of my life . <sep> yes , it does , doesn ' t it ? but this man was always over - tired , and he couldn ' t sleep . so he used to take two sleeping pill every night . <sep> i take sleeping pills sometimes . <sep> yes , but not two every night . anyway , the strain was too much for him . he had nervous breakdown and had to go to hospital . <sep> it sounds a very depressing film .
i find that every employee here respects that manager very much .
i couldn ' t look at you , and say you aren ' t beautiful ! <sep> you are pretending ! <sep> no , miss anna , you must let me say how lovely you are ! what ' s wrong with that ? <sep> it ' s wrong because - - - it isn ' t true . <sep> you know that everybody notices how beautiful you are , don ' t you ?
i hear that there is a festival called duanwu in china . <sep> yes . it is also called dragon boat festival . <sep> why are you celebrating this festival ? <sep> we celebrate it to commemorate a great patriotic poet of china — qu yuan . <sep> what do you do on that day ?
i don ' t know why people are just mad about david peckham . is there really anything so fascinating with him ? <sep> he appeals to the fans thanks to two things <sep> you mean he plays well ? yeah , he often scores by free kicks in crucial games . but a football match is by no means merely a show of taking free kicks . <sep> certainly not . what really counts is to play as a team , passing the ball amongst each other , dodging defenders . free kicks are a result of all the teammates ' collective efforts . however , a few free kicks often make everything different , especially scoring one such goal in the nick of time . <sep> in the case , maybe facial charm should be his leading card . after all , the majority of his fans are girls .
mary , how was your date with john ? <sep> it ' s ok . it seems we have a lot in common . <sep> oh , really . that is great news . what does he look like ? <sep> he is tall and slim , fair - haired . <sep> sounds like he is pretty cute . what do you think of him ? <sep> he is a nice guy and very considerate . i was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor . <sep> oh , it ' s love at first sight . when will you see each other again ? <sep> he didn ' t say , but he said he would call me . <sep> maybe he is busy with his work . just wait and try not to think about it too much ! <sep> oh , steve . stop it ! i am a bit nervous ! what if he doesn ' t call ? <sep> come on , mary , you ' re a total catch . i bet he will call you . don ' t worry .
i ' ve been looking forward to the new semester . <sep> i hope we can make great progress in this new semester . <sep> hope so . <sep> i hear we ' ll have a new english teacher this semester . <sep> really ? i hope we will do much better under her guidance .

what ' s your favorite book ? <sep> it ' s gone with the wind . <sep> why do you like it best ? <sep> i enjoy the various characters and the plot . <sep> well . i like the thom birds best . <sep> is it very interesting ? <sep> sure . i like the writer ' s language , too . <sep> if i have a chance , i ' ll enjoy the book . <sep> would you like to go to the bookshop with me ?
if i won the pools , i ' d go round the world . <sep> would you ? i wouldn ' t . <sep> what would you do ? <sep> oh , i don ' t know . i ' d buy a big house with a garden for my wife and kids , i suppose . but it ' s difficult to imagine having a lot of money . <sep> one thing ' s certain . if i had a lot of money , i wouldn ' t work any more . <sep> wouldn ' t you ? what would you do with all that spare time ? <sep> as i said , i ' d go round the world . <sep> what would you do after that ? <sep> oh , i don ' t know . it ' d take me a long time to go round the world . <sep> it doesn ' t sound very exciting . <sep> anyway , we haven ' t won the pools , and we ' re not likely to win them . so there isn ' t much point in talking about it , is there ? <sep> i ' d be happy if i got a rise . <sep> and my wife would be happy if i bought her a mink coat . <sep> well , i ' m not likely to get a rise and you haven ' t the money for a mink coat , so let ' s come down to earth and have another drink . <sep> what ' ll you have ? <sep> i ' ll have a pint of the best . <sep> i ' d have a scotch if i were you . we deserve it .
have you thought of moving at all , sarah ? <sep> we ’ ve thought about it , but my husband and i can ’ t afford it right now . the only thing we could afford would be living in the slums , which is something i don ’ t want to do . <sep> buying a house can be expensive , but there are ways to find cheaper houses . <sep> like what ? <sep> well , sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community . you ’ d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day , but you would definitely save money doing it that way . <sep> that ’ s a good idea . do you know anyone who has done that before ? <sep> sure , my sister - in - law and her husband just bought a house that way . they ’ re pretty satisfied with it . <sep> is the house pretty run - down . <sep> not at all . the woman , who owned it , took good care of it . but when she died , she had no family left and no will , so the government had to sell it for her . <sep> was it a very old house ? <sep> it was about 75 years old . there were a few repairs that needed doing , but it didn ’ t take a lot of money or time .
may i have a word with you ? <sep> certainly . <sep> when will you be free ? <sep> come by any time . <sep> shall i say around ten o ' clock ?
which church do you attend ? <sep> i am mormon , so i go to the church of jesus christ of latter day saints . <sep> what ’ s the difference between this and other churches ? <sep> mormons believe that , after the death of christ and the death of the apostles 10 , their church christ founded became corrupt and the authority of christ on earth was lost to men . in 1830 , a prophet named joseph smith was brought up by god to restore the church . <sep> then does that mean the other churches are corrupt ? <sep> that means that they all have parts of the original gospel , but not all . <sep> do you believe that mormons have all of it ? <sep> yes . <sep> why do you really go to church ?
you must be pretty excited about your trip to europe . when is it that you are leaving ? <sep> in just three weeks , and i am excited . but there are still a few things i need to do before i go . <sep> like what ? <sep> like renewing my passport , going to the travel agency to buy my plane ticket and figuring out what to do with my apartment while i ' m gone . <sep> you are not going to give it up , are you ? <sep> no way . i ' ll never find another apartment around here . but i don ' t like the idea of paying three months ' rent on an empty apartment , either . <sep> i don ' t blame you . perhaps you could sublet it . <sep> yes , but whom to ? <sep> mmm . . . let me think . oh , i know just a person . an old colleague of mine , jim thomas , is coming here to do some research this summer , from june to august . <sep> that ' s exactly when i ' ll be away . it sounds ideal , as long as the landlord agrees . <sep> tell you what , i ' ll be calling jim late this week anyway , so i ' ll mention it to him then .
i think bill clinton is a good president . <sep> but he has the sex scandal . <sep> well . maybe he isn ' t a good husband , but he is a successful president . <sep> i agree . he is also an excellent speaker . <sep> yes , he is . of course he makes mistakes , but who doesn ’ t .
he said he will get married by the end of this month .
can we talk ? <sep> sure , honey , we ’ re talking now , aren ’ t we ? <sep> you know what i mean . <sep> yeah . i know . <sep> i want to know where this relationship is going . i ’ m in love with you and i need to know . . . <sep> you know , i think you ’ re awesome . <sep> i ’ m awesome . well , i guess that ’ s my answer , isn ’ t it . <sep> honey . . . <sep> look , if you don ’ t love me , it ’ s not a thing , alright , we ’ ve had our laughs , but i don ’ t appreciate . . . maybe it ’ s just time we . . . <sep> baby , i love you so much . <sep> you do ? <sep> i love you . and i think you ’ re awesome . <sep> oh , i love you too !
my friend jane is very beautiful . <sep> what ' s her figure ? <sep> perfect . and i like her charming eyes , too . <sep> what ' s the color of her eyes ? <sep> dark blue .

guess what came in the mail today ? <sep> what ? <sep> my acceptance letter to yale ! <sep> wow ! congratulation ! when do classes start ? <sep> freshman orientation is the last week of august , but i want to go two weeks before that to get settled in . <sep> you ’ re so lucky ! do you have to do many things before you leave ? <sep> yes . i ’ ll be very busy ! i have to get a visa , buy a plane ticket , and pack my things . but first , i want to register for classes . <sep> when can you do that ? <sep> well , they sent me their prospectus , so i can start looking now . do you want to help me decide which classed to take ? <sep> sure . what can you choose from ? <sep> well , i have to take all the fundamental course , plus a few from my major . <sep> what is your major ? <sep> i hope to major in english literature , but the admissions counselor told me that many people change their major many times in their first year , so we ’ ll see . <sep> what are the fundamental course ? <sep> in order to graduate , every student must take a certain amount of classes in history , math , english , philosophy , science and art . <sep> interesting . that ’ s very different from the chinese education system . <sep> yes , it is . it ’ s also very different from the british education system . <sep> really ? <sep> oh , sure . in british , students don ’ t have to take the foundation course .
so , are you enjoying the performance so far ? <sep> well , the costumes and the set are marvellous , but the acting is a bit stiff . what do you think ? <sep> i think you ' re being a little critical . the actor in the lead role is fantastic . i suppose the chorus could be a bit better , though . <sep> do you know anyone in the play ? <sep> actually , the woman playing ophelia is a past classmate of mine . <sep> really ? is that why you wanted to come to the play ? <sep> that ' s only part of it . i absolutely adore this director . every play he works on turns out great . <sep> so you ' ve seen other plays that he ' s directed ? <sep> quite a few actually . by the way , after the play , there ' s always a big party for the cast and their friends . my friend has invited us . do you want to go ? <sep> sure , i ' d love to meet the cast ! have you ever been in a play ? <sep> i ' ve never had a part in a play before , but i used to be a part of the stage crew in high school . <sep> what did you do ? <sep> i helped build the sets and find props for the plays . what about you ? <sep> i once helped out with costumes , but i didn ' t enjoy it very much . <sep> why not ?
hey , shirley . the party has been wonderful . my husband and my children have enjoyed it very much , and me too . <sep> i ' ve said you will enjoy your life here ! <sep> i surely will . by the way , is the party like this held every weekend in our neighborhood ? <sep> oh , i ' ve forgotten to tell you . the party is held every other week . and every family gives their own performance each time . <sep> my children would like that ; they like dancing very much . <sep> that ' s good ! <sep> look ! who is that guy on the stage ? <sep> oh , my god ! that ' s my husband , benjamin . <sep> really ? <sep> he likes american idol very much , and he always imitates the contestant at home . i can ' t believe he got on the stage himself . <sep> he performs very well . he is so funny ! <sep> ok , just ignore him . i ' ve noticed there are lots of exercise facilities in our community . after dinner you can go there for a walk with your family ! <sep> ok , that ' s perfect ! by the way , is there any playground in our neighborhood ? <sep> yes , there is one behind our building . and you can play tennis there . but if you want to play tennis there , they will change you 30 yuan per hour . <sep> ok , got it ! thank you so much . you have helped me a lot !
i just got fired .

hey joanne . what are you up to ? <sep> i ' m just watching some television . <sep> i ' m so bored . i don ' t know what i ' m going to do today and it is only ten in the morning . <sep> me too . do you think we are boring people ? <sep> i don ' t think we are boring . it ' s just that we don ' t have any hobbies . <sep> that ' s right . what do you think we should do as a hobby ? <sep> that all depends on what you like to do . for example , i like to doodle on the notepad , so i ' m thinking about doing some real drawings . <sep> i like to play the piano for fun . <sep> yeah . that can be a good hobby .
i really dislike reading academic books .
i decided to go for this kind of life . <sep> try to keep cool . it ' s not an easy take . <sep> i know . i always hope for the best and prepare for the worst .

which team do you think will emerge with the last laugh in this world cup ? <sep> i wish it could be germany . but it seems they are not in a very good conditions . <sep> no , they aren ' t . they had a hard time in the group stage and only sealed a sit in the eighth - finals with wallack ' s header in the final three minutes . just think , group a consists of austria , china , and saudi arabia , all of which are minnows . <sep> it seems they ' ve been out of luck since the beginning of the event . their shots hit the woodwork as many as six times . oh . my goodness ! i ' m afraid the team is under a spell . <sep> well , at least the germans have demonstrated a very good ability to control the midfield . they recorded a total of 62 tackles in the match against austria . and they to be endowed with perfect positional sense . i think that will give rise to scoring chances sooner or later . <sep> i agree . eeven though german attackers are not good at dribbling past opposing defenders , they breach the defensive line through quick movements to the right attacking positions and through accurate , well - timed passes . <sep> that ' s why i still have very high hopes for the team . now that the tournament has proceeded into the knock - out stage , the germans will probably make it through to the finals .
do mona and jim need a new house ? <sep> no , they have a big new fancy house . <sep> does jim make a lot of money ? <sep> yes , he does . he is a science fiction writer . <sep> does jim need to make more money ? <sep> afraid so . the more the better . <sep> what do they need all that money for ? <sep> well , they spend it pretty quick . new clothes , new computers and new cars every year . and they ’ ve got a cook and housekeeper . mona used to be an actress , she likes to spend a lot of money . <sep> do they have any children ? <sep> no . they want children but no luck yet . <sep> what does jim like to do ? <sep> jim likes to travel around the world . that ' s expensive ! so he tries to make a lot of money . <sep> what does mona like to do ? <sep> oh , she enjoys spending money on fancy parties . mona loves to wear sexy dresses , and she has quite a bit of jewelry . <sep> wow . . . she sounds like a high maintenance wife . <sep> i guess so . she is also interested in politics . she knows everyone in city government . <sep> politics can be an expensive hobby . <sep> she is pretty serious about it . her uncle is a mayor . she wants to follow in his footsteps . <sep> politics is a hard game to play .
on , darn . the grocery store is closed . <sep> yeah , this one closes at ten . we could drive to the 24 - hour store on sixth . <sep> alright . we are out of everything . <sep> i wish the store close to us was open 24 - house a day . <sep> i know , our schedules are so weird . sometimes , the little corner store is the only thing within walking distance that ’ s open when we get home .
have we sold out all the newspapers for today ? <sep> yes . what a good job we have done ! <sep> why are so many extra gifts left here ? <sep> many customers didn ' t want them . <sep> how about giving them to that old man ? <sep> good idea . <sep> by the way , do you think it ' s a good idea to give free gifts to attract customers ? <sep> i ' m not sure , but still it did attract a large crowds today . <sep> i think it should be more useful to hand out some fliers which is also cheaper . <sep> but people can just throw them into the trash can as they turn around . <sep> that ' s true .
look at these clothes designed by top fashion designer like versacci , calvin klein , and vivienne westwood . what do you think of them ? <sep> well , they look lovely , but they ’ re not very practical . i mean , would you wear that dress to the office or walking down the street ? <sep> i know what you mean . people would stare at you in amazement if you wore something like that in an everyday situation . i suppose only extravagant rich people wear them at cocktail parties . <sep> maybe . i ’ m not sure why they have fashion shows like this . hardly anyone will buy those clothes . the clothes you see are nothing like the ones that ordinary people wear . it seems like a waste of money . <sep> i think that the designers hold these fashion shows for a few reasons . first , it ’ s just like a big party . they can meet each other and network . the other thing is that it is great advertising . all the journalists and photographers are there . thirdly , it give them a chance to show what they would like to see people wearing . <sep> you meant it ’ s an expression of their fantasies ? <sep> yes . i think the designers are saying that these clothes are what they would like to see people wear if those people weren ’ t concerned with what other people might think . in a way , the designers are saying ‘ don ’ t worry about what others think . wear what you like ! ’ .
how would you describe your relationship with our boss ? <sep> we have a fairly good working relationship , but there was also a rough spot . <sep> what do you think his strengths are ?

well , i finished my last final today . <sep> the end of all the hard work for my master ' s . what a nice feeling to get my degree ! <sep> do you want to attend the convocation ? <sep> certainly . after years of hard work , i wouldn ' t miss it . by the way , where can i find cap and gown ? <sep> do you want to have them made or do you want to rent them ? <sep> oh , i think they ' re provided by the school for that special day . <sep> no . those you have to provide for yourself . <sep> what do most of the students do ? <sep> well , most of them only need a cap and gown for that particular convocation service , but some of the education majors have had them made , because they will be faculty members , and they ' ll need them f <sep> then , i might as well have them made . <sep> mary , don ' t move . stand right there . it ' s a good shot . the background is very pretty . <sep> hold it a second . i want to fix my hairpin . <sep> it doesn ' t matter . say ' cheese ' .

oh . . . i am really worried about the exam . i have no idea what will be on it . <sep> why ? just read your notes . you can see what the professor stressed in the lectures . probably the exam will ask about things he stressed . <sep> yes , but my notes are all nonsense . i can ' t figure out what is important . <sep> let me see them . are these all the notes you have ? <sep> yes . <sep> but laurie , how can you do well in school if you don ' t take more notes ? <sep> what do you mean ? you think i don ' t write enough . <sep> i ' m sure you don ' t write enough . look at this . here you wrote , russian revolution . 1917 . bolsheviks . real revolution , or coup ? and that ' s all ? i remember he lectured for a half hour about that question . and you didn ' t write any of it ! <sep> i know , but i listened . <sep> yes , but did you remember ? you need good notes to help you remember . <sep> i suppose you ' re right . but what can i do ? i don ' t know what to write down . <sep> there are different things you can do . for one , the university offers a special free course on note - taking . you should go to the course . also , i am pretty good at taking notes . i can help you on this exam . i will photocopy all my notes , and you can compare them to your notes . then maybe you will see what kinds of things to write down . <sep> that would really help me , sue . i appreciate it . all this makes me feel like an idiot .

do you know where i can park ? <sep> do you need a spot here or off campus ? <sep> i want a space on campus . <sep> there ' s a parking structure for students . <sep> where can i find it ? <sep> go to the western side of the campus , and you ' ll find it there . <sep> is it full ? <sep> when i went up there , it wasn ' t full at all . <sep> when was that ? <sep> sometime this morning . <sep> would it be full now ?

which social problem do you think the government needs to concentrate on most ? <sep> i think housing is a big problem . there are thousands of homeless people on the streets . <sep> how would you solve the problem ? <sep> i have a good idea to solve it . the government could provide some money for homeless people to build their own homes . <sep> it would probably be very expensive . <sep> i think the government can afford it . besides , there are many advantages . homeless people would find it easier to get jobs if they had an address . they would learn some useful skill for finding jobs in the construction industry or home improvement . <sep> it ’ s not a bad idea . i think education is the biggest problem at the moment . schools don ’ t seem to have enough money to educate kids properly . <sep> if we are to invest more money to education , we will need to raise taxes . that wouldn ’ t be popular with voters . <sep> most voters what everything bout ways . they want the government to pay for lots of things , but without increasing taxes .
i simply couldn ’ t help giving him the fish - eye when i knew all that . <sep> but ben is not a bad man . i know him from a to z . <sep> however , he disappointed us very much this time .

is the environment a big issues in your country ? it is in mine . <sep> it is in mine too . the biggest issue is water . the climate is dry and so water conservation is very important . <sep> what methods do you use to conserve water ? <sep> water is rationed . we can only use a certain amount each month . it means that we cannot use some modern household items , like washing machines . they use too much water . <sep> i see . i think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution . <sep> yes , i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course , my country is more agricultural and has much less industry . <sep> we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years , but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .

you should have seen the t . v . show that was on last night , the topic it covered was really interesting , animal rights . <sep> do you really believe in that ? if they are going to focus on something , they should do it on civil rights . <sep> yes , but we can ’ t deny that animals are vulnerable , defenseless , and are completely at the mercy of human beings . <sep> i understand your point , but we continue to have transgressions against human rights . if so much attention weren ’ t devoted to the topic of animals , we would then concentrate more on saving a human being instead of protecting a koala . <sep> you can ’ t compare apples and oranges . i believe that both topics are important and that we can ’ t ignore them , the mistreatment of animals can cause a great environmental imbalance . i believe that governments should prohibit activities like poaching . <sep> well , you are right on that point . this is the reason that i don ’ t buy leather and i try to buy synthetic products . <sep> at least you ’ re doing your part . my contribution is to have a pet in the house that i treat like a member of the family .

sally , i ’ m tired of this western food . i really miss my mother ’ s sichuan cooking . <sep> i ’ m sure you do miss that type of cooking . but can ’ t you try to get used to western food ? <sep> i have tried . but americans like butter , bread , sugar , and cream too much . <sep> i suppose you ’ re right , lee . maybe that ’ s why so many westerners are overweight . <sep> it ’ s interesting that americans work very hard at their jobs , do not take naps during the day , and yet they can be so heavy .
my elder aunt feels like vomiting , she is pregnant . <sep> she ' d better drink plenty of hot water and lie in bed . <sep> but she feels like having no appetite at all if she stays at home all day .

it seems so strange to be here , burying you , but it ' s not you . <sep> ashes to ashes and dust to dust . . . <sep> this has been the worst and best day of my life , taylor . they kept you in the hospital , and . . . <sep> i ' ll tell you all about it another day . <sep> but you ' re ok ? it was nothing serious , was it ?

look , here ' re two coins named kai yuan tong bao — the sort of coin made in memory of the founding of a new dynasty . these two coins were made in different periods of the tang dynasty . <sep> how can you tell the difference ? from what i see , they look almost the same . <sep> the one made in the early tang period is bigger and has more characters on it , while the one with smaller and elegant characters was made in late tang period . look carefully , and tell me if you see the difference now . <sep> yes , they are different ! but it ' s too professional . what i need is just being able to tell the real from the fake . do you know any method we can use to tell a fake ancient coin ? <sep> various methods were used in history to produce fake coins . we usually send the coin to an authorized unit to have it tested by experts with special machines . we can judge it with naked eyes . <sep> i see . by the way , china was more than once ruled by foreign tribes in history . did they issue their own coins in china ? <sep> certainly , they did . liao coins and song coins , for example , coexisted in circulation during the southern song and yuan period some 800 - 1000 years ago . the liao coins look plain and bold in style , just like the characteristics of the mongolian tribe . let me look for one and show you .
at their last meeting , the stockholders voted unanimously to block the merger of our company with blycore . all the executive committee was in favor of the merger . . . i don ' t understand how the stockholders could have so much power to throw a wrench in the plans . . . <sep> if they all unite on a certain issue , it ' s the stockholders who have the final say . you ' d think it might be our ceo or the workers , but in fact , the stockholders control the money so they have the most power . <sep> is it really that simple ? it doesn ' t seem very efficient to run things that way . . .

okay , can i ask you something direct ? <sep> ha ! it ' s not like you ' ve ever been one to beat around the bush . <sep> fair enough . give it to me straight . did she bully you into this ? <sep> no , seriously . . . i really want this . <sep> i tell ya , when i got the invite , it really threw me for a loop . you ' ve done a complete 180 .

what was your wedding ceremony like , abigail ? <sep> my husband and i got married in a registry office with just two friends there as witnesses . but then we had three parties to celebrate . <sep> three parties ? that ' s quite a lot . that must have been expensive ! <sep> well , since my husband and i are from two different countries , and we live in a third country , we decided to have one in each country . it wasn ' t actually that expensive . <sep> were your parents upset that they weren ' t there to see you get married ? <sep> i would have liked them to be there , but they couldn ’ t afford to fly out to see us , and we couldn ' t afford to fly out to see them , so they understood . <sep> did your husband ' s family get to meet your family ? <sep> my husband ' s parents flew out to meet my family when we got married in my hometown , so that was great . some people spend ridiculous amounts of money on extravagant wedding receptions , but we agreed that the wedding party should be less about money and more about family . <sep> that makes sense . did you go on a honeymoon ? <sep> we waited until our one - year anniversary to go on our honeymoon to africa . <sep> you really didn ' t have a very traditional wedding , did you ?

i heard that james was fired because he got a keep back of 20 thousands dollars from a vender . <sep> that ’ s open secret . <sep> but mine could be a lie for his job .

brooke , are you still mad ? is your mom mad ? <sep> no . . . mom said that we ' ll have the wedding at home on the 2nd . so let ' s hope your mom is right about that being a lucky day . . . <sep> it will be . and today is , too . i just talked to the airlines . . . <sep> they ' re going to give us back the seats ? <sep> no , they ' re giving us discount tickets on a honeymoon package in . . . <sep> hawaii ? my dream honeymoon destination ? <sep> you got it ! we ' ll fly there directly from texas .
what are you reading about in that science magazine ? <sep> there are several interesting articles on recent scientific breakthroughs . i just finished reading one about cloning . <sep> i ’ m not sure i like the idea of that . i don ’ t want people copying me or other people . it could be very confusing . <sep> according to the article , you have no real need to worry . research nowadays is focussing on cloning parts of a human body to replace damaged or lost parts , not on recreating a whole human . <sep> in the future , that could be possible . <sep> in this article , scientists say that if you took the genes from someone and tried to create a copy of a person , there ’ s no guarantee that the copy would look or act like the original ! <sep> really ? what else have you discovered ?
want to meet for lunch this saturday ? <sep> sorry , i can ’ t . i ’ m busy . <sep> what are you doing ? <sep> i always do volunteer work on the first saturday of every month . <sep> what kind of volunteer work ? <sep> i help out at the children ’ s hospital . i help plan activities . <sep> oh , yeah ?

who was the best teacher that you ever had ? <sep> that would have to be miss baymler , my fourth grade teacher . <sep> what was she like ? <sep> she was patient , kind , fun , smart , caring , and yet strict , too . i really learned a lot from her . <sep> what kind of things did you learn ? <sep> she taught us that you can do anything that you want to do . <sep> anything ? do you really believe that we can do anything ? <sep> if you really want to do something and you work hard at it , i believe you can do it . <sep> you said she was strict . did she have a lot of rules ? <sep> she had some rules that helped us to feel comfortable . for example , the students had to treat each other with respect , or they would be disciplined . <sep> i see . she sounds like she really cared about her students . <sep> yes . she treated us all fairly . she don ’ t have any teacher ’ s pets . <sep> really ? doesn ’ t every teacher have a teacher ’ s pet ? <sep> well . to be honest , i usually sucked up to teachers because i wanted them to give me good grades . however , miss baymler didn ’ t treat me any differently . she really didn ’ t have any teacher ’ s pets . <sep> do you know what she is doing now ? <sep> as a matter of fact , i do . after she taught our class , she got married and moved to another city . then , she started writing children ’ s book . <sep> have you ever read one of the books ? <sep> of course ! both children and adults enjoy her books . <sep> why don ’ t you recommend one to me ?

get up as early as six o ' clock only to be jammed at every crossroad and still late for work . what a life ! i ' ve had enough of it . <sep> cool down , man . everyone is fed up with the rush - hour traffic . but life isn ' t really all that . you should take the initiative and make some changes first . <sep> what should i do then ? <sep> i recommend you ride a bike instead of commuting by bus . it may offer you many benefits . first , it ' s good for your health . i ' m afraid it ' s not necessary for me to further elaborate . while lots of people spend time like an hour each morning exercising , a bike ride to work not only builds you up , but also makes full use of time . you might as well sleep out for a longer hour . <sep> i know cycling is always a more favorable choice than a bus . after all , it ' s a sport . but do you think it a pleasant experience to take in the dirty , polled air on the road ?

what kind of music do you like listening to ? <sep> i like music that has a fast beat and is lively , like dance music . you know , i go to a disco almost every week . sometimes it ' s too loud though . you prefer classical music , don ’ t you ? <sep> yes , i do . i find it very relaxing . i often listen to mozart or bach in the evening after a hard day at work . <sep> i must admit that i like several pieces of classical music . it ’ s certainly more sophisticated that modern dance music . <sep> classical music is supposed to be good for you brain . research suggest that it makes your brain more active . students who listen to classical music while studying perform better . <sep> really ? perhaps i should listen to classical music often . i heard that listening to classical music is helpful in reducing stress . <sep> yes . that ’ s why i listen to it in the evenings . i usually play it as background music while i ’ m cooking or doing other housework . <sep> i ’ ve got a few classical music cd ’ s . i should follow your lead and increase my brian power . <sep> you can find plenty of recording on the internet too . you can listen to samples and then buy them very cheaply if you like them .

sorry , i overslept . my alarm clock didn ' t go off this morning . <sep> again ? <sep> that ' s right , even though i did set the alarm last night . <sep> your clock never works . perhaps you should buy a new one . <sep> well . if it breaks down again tomorrow , i ' ll definitely buy a new one . <sep> maybe by then it will be too late . <sep> what do you mean too late ?

hi , mr . zhang . what ’ s wrong ? you don ’ t look so happy . how was your date ? <sep> i was turned down again . it ’ s frustrating . i guess you ’ ve got to teach me some skills . <sep> me ? i ’ m even less experienced than you are . <sep> at least you know what american women generally like in a man . <sep> believe it or not , i guess american women like a man in good shape , which chinese women may not care about so much . that ’ s my honest opinion . i know you have been trying very hard . <sep> american men are naturally taller than chinese men . so even if i exercise , there aren ’ t many chances . <sep> no , that ’ s not true . i ’ ve met two american women who were married to chinese . but those chinese look very strong and healthy . so if you exercise more often , i bet it will surely be easier for you to date american girls . how old is jacky chan ? he ’ s small and short . but i bet he can have any american woman he wants .

management is going through a big turnover these days . with bill ' s retirement , and department realignment , we have lost about 1 / 3 of our managerial staff . they ' ve been dropping like flies . . . <sep> isn ' t that a good thing ? having fewer bosses means having less stress , don ' t you think ? <sep> actually , i don ' t think so . supervisors are really important to make sure everything goes smoothly in the workplace . they are necessary for divvying up work and disciplining employees . if there is no one to keep an eye on us , no one would get any work done . you know what they say , when the cat ' s away , the mice play .

do you think children watch too much tv ? <sep> i only allow my child to watch up to an hour a day . i don ’ t think that tv is bad for kids . i think that kids should be active and not become couch potatoes . <sep> perhaps i should impose a limit on how much tv my kids can watch . they don ’ t do much else in their free time . at least they always do their homework first . <sep> if you decide to put a limit on the amount of tv they can watch , remember to have something else for them to do . if you don ’ t , they ’ ll get bored and misbehave . <sep> they could go out and play with their friends . <sep> sure . you could talk to other parents in your neighbourhood and plan it so that all the kids are free at the same time . <sep> perhaps i could ask my husband to teach them foot ball or some thing . he watches too much tv too .
do you know anything about dr . miller ' s classes ? <sep> yes . are you in his class ? <sep> i ' m thinking of taking his class next semester . <sep> he really knew his stuff , but he graded hard . would that be ok ? <sep> yes , i really need someone who is really good . <sep> i didn ' t find it overwhelming to earn a good grade if you work at it . can you do that ? <sep> maybe , but i ' m not sure . <sep> man , this guy was so funny when he was teaching . i like that , don ' t you ? <sep> no , that stuff isn ' t important to me . <sep> did you know that he is a fairly new teacher and very current in his field ? <sep> i don ' t care about any of that .

thank you for showing me your offices , mr . becker . i can see why washington bureaucrats enjoy their jobs . <sep> why do you say that ? <sep> the city is beautiful , the off . . . , the offices are modern and comfortable , and the work is so interesting . <sep> many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . government service can be a rewarding and secure career . <sep> do you mean financially rewarding ? <sep> well , many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries . <sep> i ' ve always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy . <sep> sometimes that ' s true , but not usually . most feds are honest , hard - working professionals . it ’ s hard to keep highly trained people , so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive . <sep> how much do you make ?

let ' s got out tomorrow night . we can go to a bar and try to find you a girlfriend . <sep> i don ' t think that ' s a good idea . i am just not good with approaching someone and starting up a conversation . <sep> maybe you just need a few pick - up lines , you know , break the ice . <sep> pick - up lines don ' t work ! <sep> come on ! you can just walk up to a girl and say “ if you were a booger i \ ' d pick you first . ” <sep> what ? come on ! that ’ s just lame ! no girl would fall for that ! <sep> fine , then you can say , “ so there you are ! i ' ve been looking all over for you , the woman of my dreams ! ” <sep> that ' s a good one ! i think that ' s pretty funny . <sep> yeah , so you make her laugh , you make a fool of yourself a little bit and then you buy her a drink .

are you working overtime again ? over the last two weeks , you have worked overtime every day without a break ! your company is draining the life out of you ! <sep> i know , but i don ' t have a choice , my boss has complete control over our work schedules . i haven ' t made it out of the office before 9 pm a single day this week . <sep> well , i hope they ' re paying you the big bucks for all this work . . . <sep> no , not exactly , i ' m working for minimum wage . and they don ' t give extra pay for overtime . overtime is our own time . <sep> what ? ! isn ' t there a law against that , i think there is some legislation that requires employers to give their employees a fair rate of wages . you should know your rights ! if you are putting in so many hours , they should give you some kind of compensation . <sep> they do give bonuses at the end of the year for the employees with highest productivity numbers , but frankly , it ' s not much of an incentive . they give us a bonus of ten dollars . <sep> that ' s just wrong ! why don ' t you just quit ?

ok . let ’ s look at our short presentation on china . what do we need to include ? <sep> we need to talk about the size of the country and its population . <sep> ok . china is about the same size as canada and the united states and it has a population of about 1 . 3 billion , making it the latest country in the world by population . <sep> it says here that most of the people are han chinese , but there are 55 minorities that make up almost 10 % of the population . <sep> we need to say something about the geography and climate of china . is there any way to divide the country into sections ? <sep> we could divide into five parts . there ’ s the northeast , which is mild in summer and very cold in winter . then there is the northwest , which is largely desert . tillet is famous for its mountainous climate . the rest of the country can be roughly divided into two parts . one is temperate - mild in winter and warm in summer . then , in the south it is hot most of the year . <sep> that sounds very general . <sep> it is , buy remember that we only have a few minutes to make our presentation . we can select cities from each part and give data for each one . <sep> one from each part ? lhasa , urumqi , harbin , shanghai , and hongkong . the capital city is beijing , right ?

diana , in your opinion , which is more important , iq or eq ? <sep> why are you asking me the strange question , jerry ? <sep> i watched the movie forrest gump last night . and the question just lined in my mind . <sep> well . i think iq matters more . but it won ' t work without eq . <sep> why ? you seem pretty sure about it . <sep> because an intellectual mind can only be a beneficial thing in life . <sep> but iq is decided at birth . one can ' t expect to make a lot of improvement in it . <sep> that ' s why people ' s achievement varies greatly . <sep> that ' s true , but what if one comes across some difficulties . he must rely on his eq to deal with them . <sep> yes , jerry , can you share your understanding of eq ? <sep> i think it is independent of iq and plays a prominent role in deciding the way we live our lives . <sep> quite right . have you noticed that a high iq is not a must for one ' s success ? <sep> just as forrest ?

the air quality in this city is horrendous . the pollution levels are so high that we are not supposed to go outside with a face mask again ! <sep> exhaust fumes from vehicles cause a great deal of damage to the environment . <sep> on top of that , there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs , which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city . <sep> as much as i love this city , i think i ' m going to find a greener city to live in . living in a polluted city like this just can ' t be good for my health . <sep> i know what you mean . however , there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming . if it ' s not the pollution , then it ' s the natural disasters , deforestation , or the greenhouse effect . <sep> what is the greenhouse effect exactly ? <sep> it ' s the gradual rise in the earth ' s temperature . <sep> i see , so it ' s similar to global warming ? <sep> they ' re related to one another , yes . <sep> i heard that some people in england are pleased with the fact that the climate is becoming warmer because it ' s making their towns a more pleasant place to live . <sep> people joke about the benefits of the increase in temperature , but it ' s not all good news . they ' ve been experiencing a lot of deadly storms there as well .

are you a blogger ? <sep> sure i am . i ' ve been writing a blog for almost three years . <sep> oh , it seems that i ' m the only one who never blogs . when did you get started ? <sep> i began blogging when i first went to the us for my graduate strides . <sep> what do you usually write about ? <sep> at first , i ' ll write about my life there . like interesting things on the campus , travel stories , special english words that i come across . sometimes , i ' ll post my pictures on my blog so my friends and family can get to know how everything ' s going . <sep> that ' s interesting . how often do you write a blog ? <sep> it ' s random . if there happen to be a lot of things going on , i may add several new entries in a week , and if i ' ve got nothing to share , i may leave my blog untouched for weeks . <sep> got it . are you still updating your blog ?
ah , ah , ah . . . <sep> all right , bill . here ' s your daily exercise schedule . you are to jog before breakfast . <sep> jog ? <sep> then , you are to walk to work . <sep> walk ? <sep> thirty minutes in gym at lunch time . <sep> oh no . <sep> use the stairs , never the elevator . <sep> oh , dear . <sep> and three times a week , you can either swim , play racketball , or hand ball . <sep> oh no . <sep> ok , you can stop now . it ' s time for the dance class . <sep> dance class ! i don ' t know how .
did you know that drinking beer helps you sing better ? <sep> are you sure ? how do you know ? <sep> well , usually people think i ' m a terrible singer , but after we all have a few beers , they say i sound a lot better !
do you have any tissue , eve ? i ' ve used all mine . <sep> here . are you all right ? <sep> thanks . i am all right . it ' s just my nose . it must be an allergy . do you have any aspirin ? i have a terrible headache . <sep> i don ' t have an aspirin . perhaps you should go to a doctor . <sep> no , no . i am okay . it ' s the weather . it was warm and sunny this morning and now it ' s chilly and raining . <sep> really , john . i still think you should go to a doctor . you ' ve been sneezing ever since you entered the office this morning . why don ' t you take this afternoon off ? if you don ' t want to see a doctor , at least you can go home and have a good rest . <sep> i can ' t . i am already behind the schedule . besides , you know mr . white . he would think that i was putting him on . <sep> you didn ' t do anything but sneeze this morning , and you can ' t do anything this afternoon like this . gee ! you ' ve got a fever . <sep> do i ? oh , no . <sep> listen to me . you go home now . i will call my doctor and have him go over . ok ? <sep> what about mr . white ?
how time flies ! <sep> may and danny have already grown up . <sep> i can still remember our first date . <sep> look at that big tree over there . <sep> yeah , oh my god ! it ' s still there . we have our first date right on there . <sep> do you know that i fell in love with you at the first sight . <sep> you were dull at that time .
what shall we do after the volleyball match ? <sep> how about going to the olympic souvenir store to have a look ? i remember there is one in the gym . <sep> that ' s a good idea . i was thinking of buying some gifts for my family . <sep> me , too . what did you have in mind ? <sep> i haven ' t decided yet , but i think the olympic mascots are a must . <sep> i agree . they ' re very lovely , especially huanhuan <sep> is that the red one ? that is my favorite , too . do you know how much they are ? <sep> the five dolls are sold together as a set , and they ' re priced according to the size . the bigger they are the more expensive . <sep> oh , i see . if i buy more than a set , can i get any discount ? <sep> i don ' t think so . all the souvenirs of the olympic games are very hot right now . <sep> any other ideas ?

how did you choose courses when you were abroad ? <sep> that ' s a very good question . choosing proper courses and effectively planning a college schedule is very important to the progress toward your educational goal . in order to do these wisely and effectively , you should consult with a program adviser or academic counselor . <sep> wait a minute . there are some new terms for me . i can hardly follow you . <sep> ok , i will go into more detail . a program adviser or an academic counselor is usually an experienced professor who is responsible for all the necessary academic counseling through graduation . you can discuss with him the program selection , changing or adding a program , the requirements for graduation , and other problems related to your study . you will choose some courses , and then discuss with the adviser whether your choice can meet the requirements for graduation . <sep> everything is so new to me . i think i ' ll have to experience a very difficult period when i get there . <sep> sure , very difficult . <sep> i am very grateful for your advice .
hey , jordan , is that you ? long time no see ! <sep> oh , hey , no kidding ! i haven ' t seen you since orientation three months ago ! so how ' ve you been ? settling into college life ok ? <sep> yeah , i think so ! i pledged phi iota alpha , so i ' m living at the frat house now . <sep> oh , so you ' re a frat boy now , huh ? <sep> yeah , yeah , i know , it ' s totally cliche , but really , i think it ' s been a good decision . i ' ve got a lot of support and good suggestions from the guys . what about you ? what have you been up to ? <sep> not much . i ' m still living at home and commuting to school . i ended up dropping that metalworking class i was so excited about . it just wasn ' t as interesting as i ' d hoped . the guidance counselor suggested that i focus on my prerequisite courses so that i can make sure the credits count . <sep> that sounds smart . . . but kind of boring . <sep> yeah , it is , a little bit . i joined the great outdoors club , though , which has been a lot of fun . we ' ve gone on two camping trips already , and i ' ve made some good friends . <sep> that ' s cool . hey , so have you decided on your major yet ? <sep> definitely pre - med . what about you ? <sep> i still have no clue . . . but we don ' t have to declare a major till our sophomore year , so i ' ve got time ! oops , i ' m late for class . gotta run !

shall we go to cinema this evening ? the new blockbuster starring mel gibson is showing . it ’ s supposed to be really good . <sep> what kind of movie is it ? i don ’ t like many of his movies , actually . <sep> it ’ s a thriller . it has julia roberts playing the female lead . <sep> i like thrillers and i like julia roberts , so it might be interesting . i read a review today and the critic didn ’ t seem to be very impressed . <sep> what did the critic say ? <sep> he didn ’ t say it was bad , but he said that it wasn ’ t as good as it could have been , particularly as there were some good actors and actresses in it . <sep> the movie starts at eight o ’ clock , so we have plenty of time to eat and get ready .
mom , i just finished my paper . can you proofread it before i hand it in ? <sep> sure , let ’ s take a look . sweetie , this is terrific . your ideas are so original . <sep> thanks . <sep> i can tell you worked hard on it . <sep> i really did ! i started thinking about what i wanted to say three weeks ago .

hi , why do you look so depressed today , mike ? <sep> i had a terrible quarrel with my neighbor yesterday . <sep> how come ? <sep> it is a long story . basically , she thought i had laughed at her while i didn ' t . <sep> i know everyone suffers when he is misunderstood . but why not take it easy ?
could you help me ? <sep> what do you need ? <sep> i can ' t seem to find my class . <sep> what building is it in ? <sep> it ' s in the c building . <sep> oh , i know exactly where that is . <sep> do you think you can tell me where it is ? <sep> sure , what room number is it ? <sep> it ' s room number 261 . <sep> i have a class around there right now . <sep> could you show me where it is ?
i ' m sure he was off - side . <sep> but the ref didn ' t whistle . <sep> i think he favors the host team .
did you get the car you wanted ? <sep> no . someone had stolen a march on me and bought it . <sep> what about the car over there ?
what are you doing ? <sep> what am i doing ? what am i doing ? don ’ t you know what day it is ? <sep> mumm . no . <sep> it ’ s only the day when the world ’ s biggest sporting event is kicking off . <sep> what ? <sep> the world cup ! the first match is today ! it ’ s mexico vs . south africa ! it ’ s going to be a really good match ! both teams have a very strong offense and have skilled players . i think that south africa will probably dominate the first half since they are the host country , and all . <sep> i have no idea what you ’ re talking about . the only sporting event we watch at home is the super bowl . <sep> this is bigger than the super bowl , man ! teams from 32 countries compete against each other every four years and fight to win that trophy . they first start in a group stage with bigger groups , each group having 4 teams . the top 2 teams pass on to an elimination stage before going on to the quarter final sand semifinals . <sep> sounds interesting , but soccer doesn ’ t really appeal to me . <sep> are you kidding ? over seven hundred million people watched the final match of the world cup ! it ’ s a very exciting and nerve wracking sport ! each nation is cheering on their team , hoping they will become the next champion . so far brazil is the team with the most titles under their belt ; they ’ re really good ! <sep> all i know about soccer is that you can ’ t use your hands and that players are always falling down , trying to get a free kick or penalty kick . it seems like a sissy sport to me !
you look so happy , anna . any good news ? <sep> yes . i ’ ve won the first prize in the math contest . <sep> really ? congratulations ! <sep> thank you , paul . <sep> by the way , would you like to have dinner with me tomorrow evening ? tomorrow is my birthday . <sep> good , happy birthday to you ! <sep> not so soon . it ’ s not my birthday today . well , you ’ ll come , won ’ t you ?

i am very interested in a new apartment near the taxing plaza , but the price is very high , i really can ' t afford it . <sep> how much is it for each square meter ? how large is the apartment ? <sep> it ' s 7500 yuan per square meter , and i really like the one with three bedrooms and a large living room . its total area is about 80 square meters . <sep> that surely will cost you a lot of money . are you going to make a full payment ? <sep> do you think i am rich enough to make it ? i am thinking about buying the apartment by installments . the real estate agency says if i pay a 25 % down payment , i can move in at once .
so , you friend ’ s getting married on saturday . what have you bought her as a wedding gift . i find is so hard to choose the right gift . <sep> my friend and her fiance had a really good idea . they have cut out pictures from catalogues and pasted them in a notebook . the picture are of things they want . people sign their name by the item they will buy . <sep> that ’ s clever ! then everyone knows that they are buying something the couple really want and there ’ s no chance of two people buying the same gift . what things were in the notebook ? <sep> most of the things were household appliance . you know , everything from an iron through a vacuum cleaner to a cooker . i think it ’ s an excellent way for everyone who knows the couple to help them set up home . <sep> so , what did you get them ? <sep> i bought a sewing machine . i know that my friend likes making her own clothes , but her current sewing machine is quite old and has some problems . <sep> what ’ s wrong with it ? <sep> she says that after several years of use , it ’ s not working properly . when she uses it , it makes a funny noise . <sep> household appliance don ’ t seem to last for a long time nowadays .
do you often go to watch sports games ? <sep> i go occasionally when there ' s a game on near home , but usually i watch it on tv . <sep> can you recall the games ?
when do children start school in your country ? <sep> normally at six . before that , they spend several years in the kindergarten or pre - school education center . <sep> but thats only in the cities , isnt it ? <sep> right . in the countryside , things are more complicated . <sep> can kids in the countryside get equally good benefits and education like those in the cities ?
hello michael . <sep> hello todd . <sep> we ' re going to talk about australia . or your going to talk about australia . so first of all how any people live in australia ? <sep> australia ? oh , there ' s about twenty million people in australia right now . a little bit under , but close to twenty . <sep> ok . what are the biggest cities ? <sep> the biggest city ? the biggest city is sydney , then it ' s followed by melbourne and then brisbane and then i think it ' s perth . but most of the big cities are on the east coast of australia . and perth is on the west coast , but sort of of out there by itself . <sep> ok . um , if you had to live in one place where would you live ? <sep> i like brisbane . i had my teenage years in brisbane , growing up in brisbane , um or maybe sidney because it is a big city , but brisbane has got the gold coast and the sunshine . <sep> oh , nice . actually , what is the capital city of australia ?

why are you shivering ?
what do you think of the way people use and treat animals ? <sep> i think most people treat animals well , but we are often cruel to animals . when we raise animals for food , the conditions they live in are often poor . <sep> perhaps people should stop eating animals . we could grow more crops . <sep> what would you do with all the animals ? you couldn ’ t just let them go . besides , some people would still hunt them . meat has become an integral part of our diet . <sep> we could provide them with better conditions anyway . we should certainly try to improve the conditions at zoos . we should try to recreate the natural conditions as much as possible . <sep> that ’ s true . i think zoo are a good idea , because they allow people to get close to animals . i think it ’ s good for kids to see wild animals . <sep> i agree . i ’ m an adult and i love going to the zoo . i don ’ t like animals experiments though . i believe that we can do tests in other ways . <sep> i read that the number of animals being used in experiments is falling dramatically as new techniques are being introduced . <sep> that ’ s good news . the good thing is that most people treat their pets well . <sep> sometimes you read about people who have been cruel to pets or other animals , but those stories are rare . <sep> have you every given money to any of the charities that take care of animals .
i can ' t believe the weather is so gorgeous for your wedding . <sep> yes . it ' s perfect . <sep> and all of the flowers are in bloom .

this is tough to say , jordan , but i think we should break up . <sep> are you serious ? <sep> yes , i mean it . <sep> but why ? did i do anything wrong ? <sep> no , we are just too different . this isn ’ t working . <sep> hey , come on . it ’ s too early to say that . we can fix things . <sep> i have thought about it for a while . i think it ’ s time to move on for both of us . <sep> but i still love you . <sep> i ’ m sorry . <sep> i knew this would happen some day . . . <sep> then why didn ’ t you talk to me ? <sep> well . it ’ s not all my fault , anna . . . <sep> i don ' t want to argue with you anymore . this is going to be tough , but let ’ s try and be friends . <sep> i would like that anna , but i think i ’ ll need a little space for a bit . <sep> i think we ’ ll be better off if we are apart .

when in rome , do as the romans do , they say . <sep> what do the romans do ? <sep> they live in rome , of course , and go to work by car or bus . but sometimes it takes too long that way because of the traffic jams , so they walk . <sep> in other words , the romans do what everyone else does . <sep> yes , but they do it differently . everything is different . <sep> what do you mean ? <sep> well , the climate ' s different for a start . it doesn ' t rain so much as it does in england . the sun shines more often . <sep> i envy them the sun . <sep> i know . you hate the rain , don ' t you ? <sep> i certainly do . <sep> and a roman really ioves life . eye knows how to enjoy himself . <sep> they always eat spaghetti and drink wine , don ' t they ? <sep> not always . but they like a good meal . lots of tourists go to rome just for the food , you know .
