Speaker1:  that ’ s my little secret . did you like the snacks that i prepared ?  Speaker2:  very much . the birthday cake was delicious , wasn ’ t it ? emily told me that she and karen made it themselves .  Speaker1:  that cake tasted so good ! it disappeared within minutes , so i think everyone liked it a lot . how ’ s that stain ?

Speaker1: hey . steven . you have a large chunk of money , but why do you still live in the old flat , instead of buying a new villa ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  i like to live here and enjoy my neighbors ' company . and i don ' t think i should waste money just because i have much of it .  Speaker1:  but i found you always hate to part with your money . look at the car you drive ; it ' s such a junker !  Speaker2:  oh , the car is old but still in good condition . i just think we should be thrifty , whether you are rich or not . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  but . . . but . . .

 | 
Speaker1: julia , what do you think of the network ?  Speaker2:  network is omnipresent nowadays . it ' s quite convenient for people . you see , we can download music and information from the internet ; i can study from it , too . and the most of all , we can compose , send , and receive e - mails .  Speaker1:  yeah , you are right . internet makes our lives easier . but it ' s a two - blade sword .  Speaker2:  what do you mean ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  i mean internet brings benefit a lot , but also some disadvantages . for example , many youngsters are addicted to the games and they neglect their study ; or some bad guys steal people ' s money online , etc .

Speaker1: thank you for showing me your offices , mr . becker . i can see why washington bureaucrats enjoy their jobs .  Speaker2:  why do you say that ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  the city is beautiful , the off . . . , the offices are modern and comfortable , and the work is so interesting .  Speaker2:  many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . government service can be a rewarding and secure career .  Speaker1:  do you mean financially rewarding ?  Speaker2:  well , many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries .  Speaker1:  i ’ ve always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy .  Speaker2:  sometimes that ’ s true , but not usually . most feds are honest , hard - working professionals . it ’ s hard to keep highly trained people , so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  how much do you make ?
 |

Speaker1:  i bet it ' s expensive .
 | 
Speaker1: it ’ s so relaxing , taking a walk in the country . the air is so fresh and clean .  Speaker2:  would you like to live in the country ? i ’ m not sure i ’ d like it .  Speaker1:  i can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage . the problem is that , for me , each advantage has its own disadvantage .  Speaker2:  what do you mean ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  well , i hate the noise in the city , but i love being around lost of people . the problem is that you can ’ t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . the tow just don ’ t go together .  Speaker2:  i see what you mean . i love being far away from a city , but i hate being so far away department stores and sports facilities .  Speaker1:  people can ’ t have it both ways . if you live in the country , it is often less convenient . if you live in a city , it is noisy , buy there ’ s more to do .  Speaker2:  i would love to be surrounded by hills and streams . they ’ re so much better to look at than concrete , rows of parked cars and tall buildings .  Speaker1:  i would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face . when the wind blows in the city , you get dust in your mouth and in your eyes .  Speaker2:  the view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing . there ’ s so sign of pollution . the village looks so peaceful .  Speaker1:  just remember that in that village there ’ s nothing to do . there ’ s not even a pub or restaurant . there ’ s just one small shop with a poor selection of goods .

Speaker1: i want to leave the motorbike outdoors . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  fine , just don ' t do it at night . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  why not ?

 | 
Speaker1: how ' s it going ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  i ' m in a really good mood , actually . how about you ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  to be honest , i ' m a bit fed up .  Speaker2:  what ' s wrong ?  Speaker1:  well , my boyfriend was supposed to call me last night , but he never did .  Speaker2:  that ' s too bad . i ' m sure there ' s a logical explanation for it . don ' t be too upset about it .  Speaker1:  the thing is , this isn ' t the first time he ' s promised to do something and then didn ' t .  Speaker2:  i see how that can get a bit annoying .

 | 
Speaker1: how can i lose weight , doctor ? i seem to get fatter even when i just look at food ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  well , jim . it is a combination of how much you eat , the type of food you eat , and when you eat your meals .  Speaker1:  i never eat breakfast though .  Speaker2:  that ' s a big mistake , you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel , and yet you won ' t expect your body to work without food .  Speaker1:  i never thought about it that way .

Speaker2:  what do the other people in your apartment think about them ?  Speaker1:  most of my other neighbours are scared of them . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  maybe you should think about moving .  Speaker1:  i can ' t afford to move right now .  Speaker2:  well , perhaps you should have a party and try to get to know them better . maybe once you get to know them , they ' ll turn out to be more sensitive .  Speaker1:  i think you ' re being a bit optimistic . if you met them , you ' d understand .
 |

Speaker2:  you know what they say ' a friend to all is a friend to none ' . i don ’ t feel like i really know any of my friends . in fact , i should probably call them acquaintances , not friends .  Speaker1:  what about me ? i ’ m your friend .  Speaker2:  i know you are , you are my girlfriend . i wish i had a guy friend to hang out with sometimes .  Speaker1:  i know what you mean . i find it difficult to make new friends , too . it ’ s not as easy as it was when we were young , is it ?  Speaker2:  not at all .  Speaker1:  i ’ ve made a lot of new friends since i started learning english . maybe you could join a club or take a class to make some new friends . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  that ’ s a good idea . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  what kind of qualities do you look for in a friend ?  Speaker2:  i ’ m not sure . i guess i ’ d like to meet some people who have a positive attitude and want to have a good time .  Speaker1:  people who play ultimate frisbee have a positive attitude ; maybe you should join the ultimate frisbee club .

Speaker2:  oh . . . sure . we have an entire month ! in traditional chinese culture , ghost month is a period when the door between this world and beyond opens up and ghosts come back to earth for a visit .  Speaker1:  cool ! a whole month ! what do you do during that month ?  Speaker2:  well , people sometimes set off firecrackers , some people burn paper money as an offering and many people go to a temple to burn incense . mainly though , you need to feed the ghosts because they ' re hungry .  Speaker1:  feed them ?  Speaker2:  yeah . . . we set up tables with food , fruit and drinks and offer that to the hungry ghosts .  Speaker1:  and then later everyone eats the food ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  yes ! how did you guess that ?  Speaker1:  it makes sense , right ? who else is going to eat it ?

Speaker1: does tom drink a lot ?
 | 
Speaker1: did you hear ? the state is thinking of legalizing gambling in our city ! soon we are gonna have amazing hotels and casinos here which will be good for our business ! _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the intentional exploitation of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! it disgusts me .  Speaker1:  what are you talking about ? how does it exploit people ?  Speaker2:  well , to begin with , gambling is addictive , ruins marriages , destroys families and bankrupts communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses , cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . secondly , it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . women gamble to escape , and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction . underage gamblers often start gambling on sports with friends and then illegal bookies .  Speaker1:  geez ! now that i think about it , maybe legalizing gambling isn ’ t such a good idea ! although , i have been to las vegas , and i didn ’ t become addicted or anything like that .

Speaker1: as we know , mobile phones bring people great convenience and shorten the distance among friends and relatives . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  it bears a great many of advantages , but also some weak points .  Speaker1:  is it ? i ' ve never thought of any disadvantages of the mobile phone .  Speaker2:  for instance , the mobile phone seriously distracts the attention of people from work and study .  Speaker1:  that ' s true . some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones .
 | 
Speaker1: we ' ll miss you while you ' re studying in the united states .
 | 
Speaker1: the dinner was really good . it knocked my socks off . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  that ' s very kind of you to say so . let ' s try some after - dinner wines .  Speaker1:  great . sweet wines are my favorite . they always make a great finish to a decisions meal .  Speaker2:  do you prefer brandy or ports .  Speaker1:  port , please .  Speaker2:  excellent choice . i love its smooth flavor .  Speaker1:  the port is quite exquisite . it must have spent years aging in barrels . am i right ?  Speaker2:  yes . you always have a good nose for wines .  Speaker1:  next time we are about to dinner we should try some canadian ice wine . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  oh , what ' s that ?

 | 
Speaker1: more and more chinese are marrying foreigners .  Speaker2:  that ' s true . but i have a low opinion of those women who go out with foreigners .  Speaker1:  oh , why ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  i think some chinese wone marry foreigners for money while others just want to live abroad . there is no true love between them .  Speaker1:  i wouldn ' t say that ' s totally true . i ' ve met many happy intercultural couples .  Speaker2:  well , then why aren ' t there many east - west couples where the man is a chinese and the woman is a westerner ?  Speaker1:  i guess it ' s because the chinese women are more attractive to western men .  Speaker2:  or because they are less attractive to to chinese men . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  what do you mean ?  Speaker2:  you know , usually the woman is in her thirties and she is a left girl .  Speaker1:  a left girl ? what ' s that ?  Speaker2:  they ' re called that because they ' re left behind on the shelf . they ' re also known by their three h ' s - - - high diploma , high salary , and high degree . and they ' re also known as the three s ' s — single ,  Speaker1:  you have a point here , but i believe some mixed marriages are based on true love .

Speaker1:  i went a long time ago , before they built the new train that can take you there .  Speaker2:  would you recommend going there for a few days ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  personally , i think it ’ d be better to go when you have more time . a few days isn ’ t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital .  Speaker2:  you ’ re probably right . what do you think about yangshao ?  Speaker1:  it ’ s a beautiful city , but i think it ’ s become too touristy . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?  Speaker2:  i ’ d like to get away from the big city life .  Speaker1:  maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of beijing . i heard they are very relaxing . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  i guess if i only have a few days , i should probably think about going somewhere that isn ’ t far away .  Speaker1:  since the may holiday is the high season , you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . here ’ s the phone number .
 | 
Speaker1: what are you worrying about ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  i am worrying about my husband . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  where is he ? is he in danger ?

Speaker1: i feel that bob ’ s father - in - law is a hard nut to crack .
 | 
Speaker1: look ! there are playing the matrix today . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  you are right , look at the crowd . do you think we will be able to get tickets ?

Speaker2:  no way . i ' d rather go to another movie house . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  come on . we are already here . besides , i really wanna see this picture .

Speaker1:  i suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first , wasn ' t it ?  Speaker2:  surely it was , especially when you only knew few people and little english . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  you mean you didn ' t know much english then ?  Speaker2:  right . i only knew a few english sentences .  Speaker1:  that ' s incredible . could you tell me what you did to make a start ?  Speaker2:  first , i worked as a servant .

Speaker2:  france ? is he crazy ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  what do you mean ?
 | 
Speaker1: good afternoon , sir . you are really a regular customer here . may i ask you why you come here so often ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  i ' m a newspaper columnist . i write comments for a living . i enjoy working in a coffeehouse .  Speaker1:  i see . but isn ' t it a bit too noisy ?  Speaker2:  i don ' t mind . by contrast , i quite like the circumstances , as i can see a variety of people here , who can always give me tremendous inspiration . and the most important thing is coffee as it is my life .  Speaker1:  i can see that . then what is your favorite coffee ?  Speaker2:  irish coffee is my favorite . but i can drink any other . i ' m not particular on it .  Speaker1:  all right . would you make coffee yourself when you are at home ?  Speaker2:  not very often . making coffee is a bit troublesome . most of the time , i just buy takeout at starbucks . and also , i quite like instant coffee .  Speaker1:  i think instant coffee is becoming more and more popular . though its taste is not perfect , it ' s really cheap and convenient .  Speaker2:  exactly . nescafe is the world ' s favorite coffee . people love it all over the world ?  Speaker1:  which country makes the best coffee in the world ?  Speaker2:  many people think brazil makes the best coffee . brazil exports a lot of coffee . but i love irish coffee . so it ' s hard to say . just depends on your taste .  Speaker1:  i agree . i heard in the western countries , almost everyone likes coffee . is that true ?  Speaker2:  yes . no doubt about that . for us , coffee is more a living style rather than a simple drink . i heard chinese people don ' t drink that much coffee .  Speaker1:  no , we don ' t , especially the old people . but more and more young people fall for coffee .
 | 
Speaker1: why are there still so many people overweight despite the current fitness craze ?  Speaker2:  well , there are certain factors that effect people ' s size and weight .  Speaker1:  what are they ?  Speaker2:  one study said that low - income groups have a higher percentage of over - weight people than higher income families .  Speaker1:  why ?  Speaker2:  the survey said that the low , income groups eat more junk food on a daily basis .  Speaker1:  that makes sense . probably less time to make dinner and the junk food is cheaper .  Speaker2:  and junk food contains lots of fat and oil . there is one final reason why so many people are fat .  Speaker1:  what ' s that ?  Speaker2:  nobody exercises any more - not even kids ! the average american home has the tv on for 6 hours a day !  Speaker1:  wow ! no wonder people are so fat . say , carl , looks like you could be doing a bit more exercising . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  yeah , i guess so . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  you should consider eating healthier food and getting some more exercise .  Speaker2:  hey , i started a diet and lost 10 pounds . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  so what happened ?

Speaker1: jack and mary broke up .  Speaker2:  it ’ s so sad . they had been together for only two months . do you know what the matter was ?  Speaker1:  mary said jack was cheating on her . jack was seeing a girl from his hometown . one day , mary saw them holding hands and ended the relationship immediately .  Speaker2:  really ? i ’ m very surprised . he doesn ’ t look like a guy who ’ d ever do that sort of thing , right ?  Speaker1:  no , he doesn ’ t . anyway , she found out that he had been two - timing her for a long time .  Speaker2:  maybe it is for the best . they are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people .  Speaker1:  how so ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  he is an extrovert while she is an introvert . he likes parties while she hates them .  Speaker1:  poor mary ! she really liked him .  Speaker2:  anyway , she was right to end things and she deserves better . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  do you think they ’ ll get back together ?  Speaker2:  no , i don ’ t think so . i know mary . once she makes a decision , she won ’ t change her mind .  Speaker1:  i hope she ’ ll recover soon .

Speaker2:  no , we ' re not . we ' ve been drifting apart for a while . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  but you two used to do everything together . i thought you really enjoyed each other ' s company .  Speaker2:  we did , but since she started her new job , all she does is hang out with her new friends from work .  Speaker1:  can ' t you hang out with them , too ?  Speaker2:  i could , but all they ever talk about is work , so i always end up feeling left out .  Speaker1:  maybe you should invite her over for dinner , so it ' s just the two of you .  Speaker2:  i tried that a few weeks ago and she ended bringing a pal from work with her ! she ' s so busy these days that it ' s just impossible to hang out with her .  Speaker1:  it can ' t be that bad . she was always a really good friend to you .  Speaker2:  you ' re right . she would never talk about me behind my back or hold a grudge . but she just doesn ' t seem very interested in our friendship anymore .  Speaker1:  she ' s probably just excited about her new job . you should give her some time . it would be a shame to lose such a good friend .  Speaker2:  i ' ve given her enough time . i ' m over it now . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  i still think you two should try to patch things up .

Speaker1:  i think they gained courage after the mayor ' s speech last week on equality and opportunity for all town citizens . anyway , the sentiments have been brewing for quite some time . i mean , we all know the working conditions at the factory are quite horrendous .

Speaker2:  not really . but it has puzzled me for a long time .  Speaker1:  what ' s the puzzle ?  Speaker2:  my husband and i prefer to have no kids , but my mother - in - law is very traditional and wants grandkids .  Speaker1:  oh , i see . i think the older generation tend to think in a different way .  Speaker2:  yes . it seems she can never accept a childless marriage . we had a fight last night .  Speaker1:  oh , really ? maybe she is just eager to see her grandchildren .  Speaker2:  but it ' s absolutely our own business to have a child or not . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  definitely . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  you know , i often overhear our neighbor , the young couple , fighting about how to raise their kid and i really don ' t want kids to spoil our happiness .  Speaker1:  don ' t worry . i think in most cases , children are the glue that keeps a family together .

Speaker1:  i know . this is terrible . what can we do ? this snow doesn ' t stop falling !  Speaker2:  i told you we should have stayed in town today . the weather report said 100 percent chance of snow . why did you want to come up here ?  Speaker1:  i wanted to show you the cabin . we only had another half - hour to go .  Speaker2:  well , now we ' re stuck . what can we do ?  Speaker1:  i don ' t know .  Speaker2:  i ' ve heard that when this happens , it ' s important to save energy .  Speaker1:  what do you mean ?  Speaker2:  we ' re stranded here , tom . we may be here a long time . we need to conserve the gas in the car . the car ' s energy is what will keep us warm .  Speaker1:  i have plenty of gas .  Speaker2:  yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working . we can ' t just let the car run and run . if we do , it will die soon . then we ' ll freeze .  Speaker1:  so what can we do ?  Speaker2:  turn the lights off . then , run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  alright . that ' s a good idea . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  i wish we hadn ' t come up here . now we ' ll probably be here for days .  Speaker1:  days ?  Speaker2:  yes , it happens . that is what happens in big snowstorms . people get stranded for days .  Speaker1:  oh , my god ! it ' s good we have food .

Speaker2:  would you want to live there ?  Speaker1:  i think his house is fantastic , but i wouldn ' t want to live there . you would have to hire one or two people to clean all the rooms in the house , plus a few people to take care of the gardens , and probably an au pair or two to take care of the children . it ' s just too big of a place to take care of on your own .  Speaker2:  what ' s your dreamhole like then ?  Speaker1:  my dream home is actually just a small cottage in a quiet village in england .  Speaker2:  would you want to buy an old cottage or build a new one yourself ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  old homes are great because they ' ve got character . i think that ' s important .  Speaker2:  is that why you wear second - hand clothes as well ? because they ' ve got character ?  Speaker1:  no , that ' s just because i don ' t have enough money to buy new cloths all the time !

Speaker1: i don ’ t know what i ’ m going to do ! it ’ s going to be impossible to make ends meet if i lose my job ! _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  don ’ t worry . i don ' t think you ’ re going to lose your job over one mistake .  Speaker1:  it was a rather big mistake . when you work as an investment adviser , one small mistake can cost the company millions .  Speaker2:  but it wasn ’ t just you who was involved , right ? you were only doing what your supervisor told you to do .  Speaker1:  that ’ s true , but my supervisor is very dishonest . there ’ s no reason he needs to tell our boss the truth . i ’ m sure he will tell our boss that it was all my fault , and there ’ s nothing i can do about that . my boss won ’ t believe me if i tell him the truth .  Speaker2:  let ’ s think realistically about what might happen . how much money do you have in your savings ?  Speaker1:  i have enough to live off of for about 3 months . but i really don ' t want to spend my life savings on just living ! i ’ d rather invest my money somehow .  Speaker2:  well , you can ' t have everything . let ' s just figure out what you will do if you lose your job . when is your contract up on your apartment ?  Speaker1:  next month . so i can either move out then or renew my contract for another year .  Speaker2:  well , that ’ s good . if you lose your job , you can just move in with me until you find another job . that will save you plenty of money .  Speaker1:  that ’ s very generous of you . i guess that would work .
 | 
Speaker1: excuse me , i need your assistance .  Speaker2:  sure , what ' s up ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  i have no idea where my class is . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  tell me which building it ' s in .  Speaker1:  my class is in the c building .  Speaker2:  i know where the c building is .  Speaker1:  do you mind telling me where it is ?  Speaker2:  of course , which room number is it ?  Speaker1:  number 261 .  Speaker2:  i actually have a class right around there .  Speaker1:  can you please show me ?
 | 
Speaker1: i ' m more worried about snipers .  Speaker2:  snipers ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  sniping is when someone makes a bid at the very last minute to steal something for a bargain price .  Speaker2:  so you ' re afraid someone is going to snipe your buddha ?  Speaker1:  i heard about a software program called turbid . it automatically submits a bid with just a few seconds to go in an auction .
 | 
Speaker1: so , fred , what are your plans for after graduation ?  Speaker2:  well , i ’ ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown .  Speaker1:  that ’ s cool . have you already found an apartment to live in ?  Speaker2:  i ’ m planning on living with my parents . won ’ t you ?  Speaker1:  i couldn ’ t even if i wanted to . my parents told me that if i went home , then ’ d have to find my own place .  Speaker2:  you mean they ’ re kicking you out ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  not really , they just don ’ t want me living at home . my older sister did that , and she lived at home for seven years . once she started living at home , it got harder and harder for her to move out .  Speaker2:  well , it ’ s not like my parents want me to live at home the rest of my life . they said that it ’ s ok if i move back home to begin with , but they want me to find a place of my own after a year or so .  Speaker1:  my parents just didn ’ t handle my older sister very well , and because of that , they want me to be more independent . they think that it ’ s important that i should learn how to live on my own .

Speaker1: hi , mel , would you like to come and have a cup of coffee this afternoon ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  i ’ d love to , but you know i ’ ve got another appointment . i ’ m really sorry . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  i see . then what about tomorrow , at starbucks ?
 | 
Speaker1: ok , so who are we going to invite to our dinner party ?  Speaker2:  well , we have the thompsons , the greens , and the anderson , about twelve people total .  Speaker1:  don ' t forget my friend andy from the office . he has nothing to do on friday , so i invited him over .  Speaker2:  but that makes thirteen people ! we can ' t have thirteen people for dinner on friday !  Speaker1:  why can ' t we ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  it ' s an old superstition . if we have thirteen people at the table , then it means bad luck . can andy bring a date ?  Speaker1:  i ' m not sure . he just broke up with his girlfriend recently , and i don ' t think he ' s in the mood to start again so soon .  Speaker2:  but we can ' t have thirteen for dinner !  Speaker1:  i think you ' re making a mountain out of a molehill . it ' s only a superstition . it really doesn ' t mean anything .  Speaker2:  absolutely not ! i refuse to have thirteen people for dinner on friday !  Speaker1:  ok , ok . i ' ll ask my sister to come . that way we ' ll have fourteen for dinner .
 | 
Speaker1: i can ' t believe it , i had faith in bob and he let me down . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  i know what you mean . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  really ?

Speaker1: hello , alice . would you like to go to the temple fair with me ?  Speaker2:  temple fair ?  Speaker1:  yes . the ancient custom of holding temple fairs is to offer sacrifices to the god of the earth , and they have developed into a festival filled with food , performances and games now . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  sounds interesting ! _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  absolutely , i love temple fairs . beijing has several temple fairs recently . they are different from each other to some extent , but also have a lot in common .  Speaker2:  i just can ' t wait to see them . which one do you choose today ?  Speaker1:  what about tianqiao temple fair ? a variety of opera performances , acrobatics shows , and food will dazzle you . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  great ! do you know how to get there ?  Speaker1:  of course .
 |

Speaker1:  my daughter isn ' t feeling well .  Speaker2:  oh , no . is it serious ?  Speaker1:  i don ' t know . will you forgive me ?  Speaker2:  of course . i ' m sorry for your daughter .  Speaker1:  thank you . it ' s our first date . i hope it ' s not too offensive .

Speaker1: hello . can i help you ?  Speaker2:  yes , i hope so . i would like to register for comp lit 287 .  Speaker1:  i ' m sorry , but that class is already full . and also , students are supposed to register through the touch - tone registration system .  Speaker2:  i know . i already tried to register for it by phone , but the computer won ' t let me .  Speaker1:  that ' s because it ' s full .  Speaker2:  but i ' m a new student here . i thought maybe there was some way i could get into the class . i thought i should come and talk to you in the department office .  Speaker1:  well , i could put you on a waiting list . but that doesn ' t guarantee you will get into the class . what is your name ?  Speaker2:  my name is karen huang . that ' s spelled h - u - a - n - g .  Speaker1:  alright . and what is your major ?  Speaker2:  i ' m a comparative literature major .  Speaker1:  wait a minute . you ' re a comp lit major ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  yes , that ' s right . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  why didn ' t you tell me ? i didn ' t know you were one of our students .  Speaker2:  that ' s why i ' m trying to get into comp lit 287 . i know it ' s a required class . and professor cohen told me i need to take it .  Speaker1:  the university computer system saves extra places , in class 287 for comp lit students . i can give you a special code . when you register by phone , you can use the code to get into the class . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  even if the class is full ?  Speaker1:  that ' s right .  Speaker2:  oh , i didn ' t know that .  Speaker1:  sure . here is the code number , with information on how to use it .  Speaker2:  thank you . so you think i will be able to get in with this ?  Speaker1:  sure . just call the touch - tone registration system again . then , follow the directions on the sheet . you will get in no problem .

Speaker1:  why ? what do you mean by that ?  Speaker2:  well , haven ' t you heard ?  Speaker1:  heard what ? no one ever tells me anything .  Speaker2:  well , apparently , he ' s been having an affair with his secretary . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  really ! how fascinating . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  according to mary , he ' s divorcing his wife and there ' s a big fight going on about the children . i thought everyone knew .  Speaker1:  well , what can i say ? i didn ' t know . oh , i meant to tell you earlier , your blouse doesn ' t really match your skirt . those colors don ' t really suit you either .
 |

 | 
Speaker1: i ' m reading an interesting report on mars .  Speaker2:  oh , what does it say ? does it say water could still exist under the surface of mars ?  Speaker1:  absolutely ! it says there is water on mars buried beneath the surface . it ' s just a matter of how deep it is . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  then could the soil on mars somehow be fertile enough to groh simple plants ?  Speaker1:  the soil would need quite a bit of fertilizer to grow anything . and it would need to be protected from the uv radiation .  Speaker2:  actually , we are doing a project in school that involves landing a ship and staying on mars for an extended period of time . does nasa have any type of portable habitats that could be used to stay on the planet ?  Speaker1:  i ' m not sure nasa has built any portable habitats for extended stays on mars , but they have looked at various designs .  Speaker2:  one of the most exciting things about mars is that there could have bean life on it . what are your personal opinions on the life on mars theory ?  Speaker1:  well , i ' m not really an expert in this area , but my understanding is that anything is possible . it ' s just that it is so hard to determine what went on 4 . 5 billion years ago .  Speaker2:  but maybe there is a chance of gradually improving the surface and atmosphere of mars so it may be inhabitable by humans .  Speaker1:  i ' m skeptical . mars is made of rocks containing silicon , iron , and various minerals . it also has an atmosphere of carbon dioxide . it is so different from what we have on earth , you know .

Speaker2:  that italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions . do you want to go there ?  Speaker1:  i ' m not really in the mood for italian , actually . i was thinking of something a bit spicy .  Speaker2:  if you want spicy food , then i ' d recommend going to a thai , indian or chinese restaurant . how about that chinese buffet on cowley road ?  Speaker1:  i really like that restaurant ; you get a lot for your money there . but , they ' ve westernized their food , so it ' s not actually that spicy .  Speaker2:  you ' re right . most of their dishes have sweet sauces . we could try that indian restaurant just down the road from us .  Speaker1:  the taj ? they ' re a bit expensive , but they do serve large portions of very hot food .  Speaker2:  the taj it is then .  Speaker1:  shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money ?  Speaker2:  they ' ll still charge us a corkage fee . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  that ' s right . it ' ll probably work out to be about the same then anyway .  Speaker2:  don ' t worry about money . i ' ll treat you tonight .  Speaker1:  are you sure ? we could go dutch .

Speaker1:  you shouldn ' t use my example . it wasn ' t special . i kind of wish i made it more special but it ' s too late now .  Speaker2:  what do you think i should do ?  Speaker1:  there are a lot of options . you can surprise her over dinner , or ask her in a public area , or if you have the balls , ask her father in front of her .  Speaker2:  i never thought about that .  Speaker1:  thought about what ?  Speaker2:  asking her father in front of her . how do you think she will react ?  Speaker1:  i don ' t know . you should know how she ' s going to react . she is your girlfriend .

Speaker1: alright everyone settle down . let ’ s get started . as you know , an important aspect of becoming a good citizen is understanding the genesis of our legal system . it is not enough to simply memorize our laws , it is necessary that we comprehend why and how they were formed . this brings me to our topic for today . does anyone know what we celebrate on may first ?  Speaker2:  cinct de mayo ?  Speaker1:  no , that ’ s may fifth in spanish , james , no wonder you are failing my spanish class . no , may first is international workers ’ day .  Speaker2:  do we get a day off from school then ?  Speaker1:  no ! it is not considered to be a national holiday here in the us , but in other countries it is .  Speaker2:  www , man ! _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  in the nineteenth century , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , and fourteen hours a day . support for the eight - hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by april 1886 , 250 , 000 workers were involved in the may day movement . previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . they passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ’ s work . and , on may first 1886 , the resolution took effect .  Speaker2:  cool ! is that why we only work eight hours now ?  Speaker1:  yes ! but the happy ending came at a high price . on may third , 1886 , police fired into a crowd of strikers at the mccormick reaper works factory , killing four and wounding many . a mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality .

Speaker1:  not sure yet . how about you pop the hood and we can take a look . mmmm , it doesn ’ t look good .  Speaker2:  what do you mean ? my daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . it ’ s brand new !  Speaker1:  well missy , the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . you overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . you should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  ugh . . . so how long is this going to take ? an hour ?  Speaker1:  i ’ m afraid a bit more than that . we need to order the spare parts , take apart your electrical system , fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . you are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks .

Speaker2:  have you visited it before ?  Speaker1:  many times . except climbing , there are many attractions worth visiting .  Speaker2:  like what ?  Speaker1:  it is the best season to view red leaves from the mid - october to the first ten days of november . during the period , thousands of hectares of maples on the sloping field are so red that you would recognize them as fallen petals by mistake if looking from a further area . the bright red , pink , scarlet , and peach - puff leaves are distributed in different layout , with some green pines and cypresses dotted in between . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  sounds marvelous . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  you can take a bird - eye view at the glorious picture when you arrive at the top of the mountain .

Speaker1:  that ’ s not a big problem . there are many small schools for adults like you who can study to be certified . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  i guess i never thought of that before .  Speaker1:  and you can easily get a student loan from a vocational school , or from the government .

Speaker2:  how do you find studying a language on the internet ?  Speaker1:  it ’ s not easy , particularly with listening and speaking , because sometimes the connection isn ’ t too good .  Speaker2:  i bet you find the character difficult to write !  Speaker1:  actually , many of the characters are the same or very similar in both chinese and japanese , so they ’ re easy for me .  Speaker2:  so , you can read and write much better than you speak and understand other speakers , right ?  Speaker1:  yes . how are the spanish classes going ?
 |

Speaker1:  i agree completely . i just don ' t understand what ' s wrong with them . don ' t they have any humanity ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  well , maybe they ' ve got a point . i mean , i suspect that they think the same about us . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  yes , but that doesn ' t make them right , does it ? just because they think so ?  Speaker2:  i guess not . my view is that we should give in to their demands , so that innocent people can stop getting killed .  Speaker1:  come on , you can ' t be serious ! we should never give in to terrorist ' s demands , otherwise where would we be ?  Speaker2:  well , that ' s probably true , but i don ' t think we should be dogmatic about it . a colleague of mine was kidnapped once , so perhaps i have a different view of things . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  really ? what happened ?
 |

Speaker1:  i ' ve got an old ericsson . here . take a look .  Speaker2:  wow , that ' s really old .  Speaker1:  yes , i like collecting antiques .  Speaker2:  why don ' t you get a new one ?  Speaker1:  i don ' t know . i like this one , and i don ' t have any need for all the bells and whistles you get on the new ones .  Speaker2:  really , what makes you say that ?  Speaker1:  well , i just need to make and receive calls , and it ' s quite reliable . i find that the more fancy stuff they put into these things , the more likely they are to break bown or go wrong , you know ? i mean , this camera function , for instance - how often do you use it ?  Speaker2:  sometimes , but i guess not very often . it ' s more for fun . sometimes when i ' m on a trip , for example , i can take a picture and send it to my kids . or i can send a picture of a sample back to my office and get it costed up immediately .  Speaker1:  well , that ' s nice i guess . so how many kids do you have ?
 |

Speaker2:  well , it ' s started raining since then . look out the window ! it ' s pouring rain out there !  Speaker1:  have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?  Speaker2:  it does , actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .  Speaker1:  that ' s a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail doesn ' t dent it .  Speaker2:  ok . i ' ll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it ' s a bit chilly in here .  Speaker1:  how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?  Speaker2:  i don ' t know . the weatherman didn ' t say anything about this in his weather report last night .  Speaker1:  maybe we should turn on the news in case it ' s supposed to get worse .  Speaker2:  i don ' t think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  good idea . that will help us to warm up .

Speaker1: hi ! i see you are having fun with your new computer and internet connection . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  there ’ s so much i want to do . i ’ ve just finished sending lots of emails to friends and family all over the world . i just ran a search for music to download .  Speaker1:  i can give you the name of a few useful website to visit .  Speaker2:  thanks . that would be very helpful . i ’ ve discovered that it can take a long time to find exactly what you want . there ’ s too much information on the net .  Speaker1:  when you sent your emails , did you attach any files to them ?  Speaker2:  yes , i did . there ’ s an anti - virus program with my email account that scans all attachments , so i ’ m sure i haven ’ t sent anything nasty to anyone .  Speaker1:  when you use the internet , be careful not to give out your email address very often . if you do , you might get a lot of spam - unwanted email from companies trying to sell you things .  Speaker2:  that ’ s good advice . i should also be careful about giving out confidential information about myself , such as my password and credit car number .

Speaker1:  take this web page for example . press the keys “ control ” and “ d ” together . click on “ favourites ” at the top of the screen . there you are . it has been added to you favourites list . if you click it , you will automatically go to that web page again .

Speaker2:  i think the government fined him a small amount , and he kept the rest in his foreign bank accounts . he ' s still a millionaire .  Speaker1:  that ' s the kind of thing in america that gets me mad . some guy pulls off a stock scheme and makes millions while spending the bare minimum sentence in jail .  Speaker2:  i know . and some poor guy that robs a liquor store makes $ 500 at most and ends up in jail for five to ten years .  Speaker1:  yup , you got it . criminals in america do a lot better if they ' re white - collar thieves .

Speaker1:  what was she thinking ? did you confront her about it when you saw her ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  i wanted to , but i knew that if i spoke to her , i ' d just blow up at her , so i decided to just go home . i called her later that night , but she didn ' t answer the phone .  Speaker1:  i can ’ t believe she would do that to you . it ’ s so dishonest - - - and rude !  Speaker2:  i know . i still haven ’ t heard from her . the good thing is that i ’ m so angry with her that i don ’ t feel sad about not having her around .  Speaker1:  i bet you she regrets what she ’ s done . you were such a good catch ! she really lost out , didn ’ t she ?

Speaker1: what kinds of tv programs do you enjoy watching ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  i like current affairs programs and documentaries , especially wildlife ones . how about you ?  Speaker1:  i like those kinds of programs too . they ’ re very informative . i think that many people underrate the education value of tv .  Speaker2:  i agree . people often criticize tv for showing too much sex and violence .  Speaker1:  yeah . and that ’ s so funny because most people prefer watching sex and violence to watching something more educational !  Speaker2:  right . you can ’ t blame the tv stations for showing popular kinds of programs . they need to make money from advertisements shown during and between programs .  Speaker1:  in my country , there ’ s a time limit on the advertisements that can be shown . i think it ’ s about six minutes per hour .  Speaker2:  that ’ s great idea . but don ’ t the tv station lose a lot of money because of that ?  Speaker1:  no . they don ’ t . they simply charge higher prices at peak times . is there no limit on the amount of advertisements that can be shown on tv in your country ?  Speaker2:  not as far as i know . we have so many advertisements . the interruptions are unbearable sometimes ! that ’ s one reason that many people prefer satellite or cable tv , where you pay a fixed amount each month .  Speaker1:  some people have satellite and cable tv in my country , but people don ’ t seem to keen to pay for their tv programs . besides , the terrestrial channels offer a good range of programs .

Speaker1:  my pleasure . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  i really wanted to watch the star wars on the opening day , but the pre - sale tickets were sold out . how did you manage to get hold of them ?  Speaker1:  a friend of mine works at the corporate headquarters of pepsi , which is a major sponsor of the movie . he was able to get the tickets for free , and then he sold two more for me for 50 dollars a piece .  Speaker2:  you paid 50 dollars for each ticket ? that ' s a huge premium over the regular price .  Speaker1:  not really . considering the fact that other people were willing to pay as much as 200 dollars each on the black market . besides , i knew you were really looking forward to watching star wars on the opening day .  Speaker2:  wow ! i am really honored you went through all this trouble just for my sake . i really appreciate that . so , what time are we going ?

Speaker1: can i help you ?  Speaker2:  yes . i am a bit confused . my sociology class is supposed to read a chapter in a book called sociology and the modern age . according to the syllabus , the book is in the library , but i haven ' t been able to find it .  Speaker1:  do you have your syllabus with you ? may i see it ?  Speaker2:  yes , uh . . . i put it in the front of my sociology notebook . oh , here it is .  Speaker1:  let me see . oh yes . your professor has placed this book on reserve . that means you cannot find it on the shelves in its usual place . you need to go to a special room called the reserve room . it ' s down the hall and to the right .  Speaker2:  i ' m sorry - i still don ' t understand .  Speaker1:  you see , your professor wants every one in the class to read the chapter . if one student removes the book from the library , it is likely that none of the other students will have the opportunity to read it . so , your professor has insured that all students have the opportunity to read it by placing it on reserve .  Speaker2:  so , will i be able to find this book ?  Speaker1:  yes , when a book is on reserve , a student can go to the reserve room and ask the reserve librarian for the book . the student can have the book for a few hours , and he or she must read it in the library during that time . that way , the book stays in the library , and all students have a chance to read it . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  okay . thank you . i understand now . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  will there be anything else ?

Speaker2:  well , it costs an arm and a leg — 30 yuan per person . what a costly sport ! that is why i have to refrain from even thinking about it . and i find jogging a very agreeable substitute .  Speaker1:  haha , jogging ? perhaps it might be a bit too boring ?

Speaker1:  four hundred ?  Speaker2:  no need to sweat it . my parents agreed to pay for most of the wedding , which is going to be low - budget anyway . so roughly four hundred people , which means that the hall at northwoods heights will be our reception venue . i thought it would be nice if we had the wedding at your parents ’ church and my uncle of course would be officiating . we ’ ll meet with him soon for some pre - wedding counseling . the music for the wedding ceremony was a no - brainer . my step - sister and her string quartet will take care of that . my cousin will be the official photographer . i thought it would also be nice if his daughter could sing a solo . did you know that she ’ s going to be a professional opera singer ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  ah . . . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  and then of course the ladies at the church would love to be our caterers for the banquet and we ’ ll get the youth group to serve us . i was thinking that your friend ’ s band could be our entertainment for the night . though they might have to tone it down a bit . or we could hire a dj . your sister ’ s husband could get us a discount with that company that does the decor at weddings . what ’ s their name again ? i was thinking that we could have an island paradise - themed wedding and our theme color would be a soothing blue like aquamarine . and there will be a huge seashell on the wall behind the podium where we ’ ll make our toasts ! what do you think of small packages of drink mixes for our wedding favors ? who else am i missing ? oh , your uncle could be our florist and his wife could make our wedding cake ! _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  wow .

Speaker2:  yes , of course . i can ' t go through a day without coffee in the morning . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  me too , but i think we shouldn ' t drink too much of it , as it ' s not very healthy .  Speaker2:  i totally disagree . the other day i read in a book that a number of recent studies suggest that it can be a highly beneficial drink . researchers have found strong evidence that coffee reduces the risk of several serious aimed 3 ' including diabetes , heart disease and cirrhosis of the liver .  Speaker1:  but i also heard that coffee and its caffeine content , serve as a drug on the human body that negatively affects the central nervous system , as well as other organs , and leads to addiction  Speaker2:  i don ' t think so . coffee helps me wake up , keep alert , and improve my short term memory .  Speaker1:  well , i adjust going to have to disagree with you . a healthy body wakes up without caffeine ! _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  maybe you are right to some extent .

Speaker2:  i think it is centrally controlled . they control it at the main desk .  Speaker1:  well , they have it too cold in here . i want to be warmer . i won ' t be able to sleep .  Speaker2:  i ' m going downstairs for more drinking water . i will ask them .  Speaker1:  what did they say about the air conditioning ?

Speaker1: tomorrow will be my first day at work , what do you think i should be wearing ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  well , if you want to look professional , serious and more conservative , a blue dress , white shirt and not - too - high shoes would be the best choice . but sometimes , very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . it depends on the company ’ s dress code .  Speaker1:  indeed , i found most of the employees dress casually when i went to the interview . only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . it seems that their dress code is not that formal . probably , i should put on car key and simple shirt .

Speaker1:  the card doesn ' t actually give you discounts on beer . but it will give you discounts on certain club cover charges . so if you want to see your favorite band at amy ' s or cosmo ' s club , you get a discount on the entrance fee .  Speaker2:  that ' s pretty cool . how much of a discount ?  Speaker1:  usually it ' s two dollars off the cover price .  Speaker2:  and all these other things , pizza and movies for instance - - how much of a discount do i get on that stuff ?  Speaker1:  this pamphlet shows you what restaurants and movie theaters have discounts . and twice every semester we will send you a new issue of the pamphlet . the bucky card has just started . every couple months we have new businesses joining our program . it ' s a great way for students to save money !  Speaker2:  alright , alright . let me look at that pamphlet . hmm . alessio ' s pizza parlor . that ' s cool . i go there all the time . and cosmo ' s club . and 4 - d records . alright . how much does it cost ?  Speaker1:  it costs only 19 dollars a year for a card .  Speaker2:  whoa ! that ' s expensive ! it should be cheaper .  Speaker1:  but think of how much money you ' ll save ! you can use it for a year .

Speaker1:  me too . recently , i ' ve made many friends on the net . every day i talk to them and share many interesting things with them .

Speaker1:  yes . but now i ’ ve learned differently . now i have a more realistic opinion .  Speaker2:  what do you think now ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  there are lots of jobs , and almost everybody works . there is a high standard of living . people earn a lot , but they spend a lot to live . so there isn ’ t so much money after all .

Speaker1:  not at all ! i like the design so much . the designer must have thought really hard to come out with such a brilliant concept .

Speaker1: so what did you think about the movie ?  Speaker2:  well , i think this star wars episode is an excellent piece of work , but not as good as the previous ones .  Speaker1:  really ? i don ' t agree . this star wars episode was incredible !  Speaker2:  why do you think so ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  well , one of the most spectacular things about this one was the special effects . state of the art special effects are the main reason for the success of previous episodes , so audiences have high expectations for this one , and i don ' t think they will be disappointed .  Speaker2:  you are right . the special effects were amazing . and i like the fact that they created so many fantastic settings and otherworldly costumes , weapons and creatures .  Speaker1:  it ' s kind of cool that they are still using the same star wars theme song for this movie .  Speaker2:  yeah ! it reminds me of the previous star wars scenes .  Speaker1:  i know exactly what you mean . hearing that song gives me a nostalgic feeling .  Speaker2:  i thought the overall plot of the movie was very interesting , but i don ' t think the character development was that strong .  Speaker1:  do you think that they had anything to do with the casting of the movie ?  Speaker2:  no , the casting is great and the actors were excellent . they just didn ’ t have a lot of funny or meaningful dialogues . the writing was also a little weak .  Speaker1:  well , maybe . but i like the little kid who played manakin skywalker . i can ' t imagine anyone else playing that role .  Speaker2:  i liked him too . he is so cute ! you know , even though i was slightly disappointed , i can ' t wait for the next episode . i wonder when they ’ re going to start making it and when it ’ s scheduled for release ?  Speaker1:  i ' ve no idea . but looking at the success of star wars episode , i ' ve a strong feeling production for the next episode will be selling pretty soon . i hope it will be even better than this one . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  i hope so , too .  Speaker1:  well , i think we should go now . it ' s getting pretty late .

Speaker2:  confusing . but not , because it ’ s nothing .  Speaker1:  where ’ d you meet him ?  Speaker2:  oh , listen , i can ’ t even remember . ok , on my birthday , i wandered into over 30 rooms , for a joke , sort of and he was there , and we started chatting . . .  Speaker1:  about what ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  oh , books , and music , how much we both love new york . harmless , harmless , meaningless . bouquets of sharpened pencils . oh . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  excuse me ?

Speaker2:  do you feel like dancing ?  Speaker1:  yes ? why not ?  Speaker2:  alright . at least that ' s better than sitting in a bar with your alcoholic friends .  Speaker1:  they aren ' t alcoholic !  Speaker2:  no , maybe they ' re not . but they ' re close .  Speaker1:  so where should we go ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  let ' s go to the latin club . i think they will have a brazilian band there this weekend . maybe it ' s friday night .

Speaker2:  no . but they play techno all the time . it drives me crazy after forty minutes . and anyhow , if we go to the latin club you could actually learn some latin dance steps . at the new bar you ' ll just shake yourself around for an hour . and then you ' ll get sick of stand you ' ll want to go get drunk somewhere where the drinks are cheaper . i know you .  Speaker1:  it ' s fine with me if we go to the latin club . i like latin music . the only thing i never want to do again is listen to country rock . what was that bar called ?

Speaker1:  well , you ’ d better get some rest .

Speaker2:  it ’ s hard to say . language isn ’ t like other studies .  Speaker1:  you mean i could finish this course and still not know english ? you ’ ve got to be kidding !  Speaker2:  i ’ m not kidding . learning a language is a question of forming language habits and that takes time .  Speaker1:  so do we have to stay in this english class forever ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  no . you just have to stay here long enough to get some orientation . then you go on practicing and learning outside . a lot of learning depends on your personal motivation .

 | 
Speaker1: you ' re going to get into a lot of trouble if you do that .  Speaker2:  what makes you say that ?  Speaker1:  i don ' t see anything wrong with what we ' re doing ! that ' s just the problem . in these kind of things , the trouble doesn ' t always appear at first . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  but everything has been so easy . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  everything has gone as smooth as clockwork . just like we planned ! that may be true , but if you were to do it , you would have trouble on the horizon . you always say that .

Speaker2:  i think it ' s too short . you ' d better say something about your work experience . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  you ' re right , i ' ll change it . how about the last part ?
 |

Speaker2:  oh , i see . i like to do those tests , too , but i don ’ t take them seriously .  Speaker1:  of course not , but sometimes the results make you think about yourself and what you do . according to the jealousy test , i ’ m quite a jealous type of person . perhaps i need to control my jealousy .

Speaker1: i can ’ t believe my english teacher is making me read pride and prejudice !  Speaker2:  why not ! it ’ s a classic ; in fact , it ’ s one of my favorite novels .  Speaker1:  but it ’ s so old .  Speaker2:  don ’ t judge a book by its cover . do you kwon what it ’ s about ?  Speaker1:  no , not at all .  Speaker2:  first of all , it ’ s a romance novel , set in the early 19th century .  Speaker1:  i didn ’ t realize it was a romance novel . what ’ s the main storyline ?  Speaker2:  it ’ s basically about a father who tried to marry off one of his five girls .  Speaker1:  why does he want to do that ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  since he doesn ’ t have a son , he hopes that one of the girls will marry a wealthy man . that way , all of his daughters will be cared for .  Speaker1:  won ’ t they get his inheritance ?  Speaker2:  no , that ’ s the problem . though they are well - off , once he dies , his house will go to his cousin . so , when he dies , the girls will have nothing .  Speaker1:  i see . this sounds interesting ! maybe my teacher isn ’ t so horrible after all .  Speaker2:  so , are you going to read the novel or watch the movie ?  Speaker1:  there ’ s movie ? my teacher didn ’ t tell me that !  Speaker2:  that ’ s probably because she wants you to read the book first . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  it would take a lot less time . .
 | 
Speaker1: what is the matter with him ?  Speaker2:  i don ' t know , what ' s wrong ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  i feel he is as cold as charity to me .

Speaker1: are there many idioms in english ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  there are hundreds and hundreds . english is particularly rich in idiomatic expressions . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  can you give us an example ?  Speaker2:  i ' ll look up the rate . to look up doesn ' t mean to look high into the sky or to look at the roof . it means to search for and find some information .  Speaker1:  what about the expression " goodbye " ? is that an idiom ?

Speaker1: it seems the department still has some money left in the budget . do you have any suggestions how to use it before the budget is renewed ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  what about renting a restaurant and treating the employees to a nice dinner ?  Speaker1:  but we ' ve done that many times . we want something fresh this time .  Speaker2:  okay , let me think . what about a party - and - movie night ? we can rearrange our reference room , invite a band to play some music , order in some food and watch a movie later .  Speaker1:  sounds like a good idea , but a band sounds too expensive .  Speaker2:  well , we can ask people to make small contributions .  Speaker1:  i don ' t think so . i don ' t think people are going to like it if they have to pay to come . but we certainly can cut costs in other ways , such as make the party byob .  Speaker2:  byob ? what ' s that ?  Speaker1:  bring your own beverage . we can provide food , but people have to bring their own drinks .  Speaker2:  so we ' re just going to have a party where they bring their own drinks and we just give them some snacks ? i don ' t know how well that will go over .  Speaker1:  maybe you have a point . how about having a party on a friday afternoon ? we ' ll stop early , order some pizza , and serve drinks . there ' ll be music but no band . having the party in the office will make

Speaker1: just don ' t understand why we have to take the subway . look at this place . it ' s modern enough . but it ' s far from lively .  Speaker2:  it ' s convenient . people in network go everywhere by subway if they don ' t drive .  Speaker1:  this isn ' t network , frida . we are in san francisco .  Speaker2:  what ' s the difference ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  we haven ' t come here in business but for pleasure . we should go out exciting . what can you see in the subway ? nothing !  Speaker2:  what can you see from a tram or a double - decker ?  Speaker1:  i can see people who are walking on the sidewalk . i can see cars driving on the streets . i can see the sun shining and beautiful flowers dancing in the wind . i can even smell the scent of flowers and the freshness of the air .  Speaker2:  but they are not as convenient as the subway .  Speaker1:  you miss the point ! we are not in a hurry to go anywhere .  Speaker2:  well , maybe you are right . we ' ll be more amused in a tram or a double - decker than on the subway . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  i ' m so glad you can finally see things in my way . can we leave this dull place now ?

Speaker1: what do you think of the way people use and treat animals ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  i think most people treat animals well , but we are often cruel to animals . when we raise animals for food , the conditions they live in are often poor .  Speaker1:  perhaps people should stop eating animals . we could grow more crops .  Speaker2:  what would you do with all the animals ? you couldn ’ t just let them go . besides , some people would still hunt them . meat has become an integral part of our diet .  Speaker1:  we could provide them with better conditions anyway . we should certainly try to improve the conditions at zoos . we should try to recreate the natural conditions as much as possible .  Speaker2:  that ’ s true . i think zoo are a good idea , because they allow people to get close to animals . i think it ’ s good for kids to see wild animals .  Speaker1:  i agree . i ’ m an adult and i love going to the zoo . i don ’ t like animals experiments though . i believe that we can do tests in other ways .  Speaker2:  i read that the number of animals being used in experiments is falling dramatically as new techniques are being introduced .  Speaker1:  that ’ s good news . the good thing is that most people treat their pets well .  Speaker2:  sometimes you read about people who have been cruel to pets or other animals , but those stories are rare .  Speaker1:  have you every given money to any of the charities that take care of animals .

Speaker2:  which university should i apply to ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  there are many universities for you to choose from . some famous universities such as harvard , yale , the university of michigan , and massachusetts institute of technology are really wonderful places to study , but they are very competitive and expensive . some smaller universities or institutes are also very nice but much cheaper .

Speaker2:  don ' t get me wrong , i ' m not saying he ' s like that all the time .  Speaker1:  so , can i trust him or what ?  Speaker2:  well , i think you should decide for yourself .  Speaker1:  but i need someone that i can count on for this job .  Speaker2:  okay , okay . you can trust him . i was just trying to give you a hard time .

Speaker1: sometimes i think television is too biased . none of them are completely objective . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  that ' s unavoidable , but think , how would you keep up to date without television ?  Speaker1:  newspapers or the radio i guess . i just wish tv was more objective .  Speaker2:  look , you can still learn a lot from watching television , you just need to be smart when you ' re watching . filter the information and decide if you believe what you are hearing or not .  Speaker1:  the internet ' s a lot worse . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  really ? why ?  Speaker1:  there ' s no one moderating it . anyone around the world can put information onto the net for anyone else to see . the information on the internet is mostly unsubstantiated and you can never know who has written it , or why . a lot of people get conned online .

Speaker1: i went to the doctor yesterday .  Speaker2:  i beg your pardon ?  Speaker1:  i said i had been to the doctor the day before .

Speaker1: tiffany , why are more and more people turning to the web to find a mate ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  i think that , as more people use the internet for both work and pleasure , it makes more sense as a tool to connect with people , and the stigma of meeting someone online is reduced .  Speaker1:  there are actually special sites for people looking to date within their specific ethnic group and age group . but how should you screen potential mates ? do you suggest talking to them on the phone right away or communicating via e - mail ?  Speaker2:  i would say do not make the e - mail exchange too long . a lot of times a connection via e - mail creates almost a false sense of intimacy . quickly make sure there is a connection in the physical world .  Speaker1:  can you give us any other safety tips for people pursuing relationships on the net ?  Speaker2:  i ' d suggest you not give out too much personal information , like your home address , until after several dates . just keep up the same guards you would keep up if you were meeting any stranger .  Speaker1:  besides the growth of these matchmaker sites , do you have any stats on success rates ? are people out there finding true and lasting love through the internet  Speaker2:  well , for a site like ecrush . com , since their debut in valentine ' s day in 1999 , of the 1 . 5 million people who have joined ecrush . com , 300000 have actually matched . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  do you have any successful stories to share ?

Speaker1: isabelle , you know i ' m not interested in fame .

Speaker1: here ' s some dancing . see those guys stomping , clapping and shouting ? they ' re practicing step - dancing . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  it sounds cool . the rhythms look really difficult .  Speaker1:  they basically turn their bodies into drums . there ' s a national step competition every year .  Speaker2:  well , black people are supposed to be great dancers .  Speaker1:  wen ! that ' s only a stereotype . like all asians are supposed to be math geniuses . i ' m not a great dancer , and you said you failed calculus .

Speaker1: this is the end , jane . i don ' t want a girlfriend who goes out with other guys all the time .
 | 
Speaker1: what ' s the bonus like at your company ?  Speaker2:  well , it ' s ok , i suppose . we get about the equivalent of six months ' salary .  Speaker1:  six months ' salary ? are you serious ? that ' s incredible ! _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  maybe . but you ' d be amazed at how little ' s left after the credit companies have deducted their share from my account .  Speaker1:  hey , i know what that ' s like . i bought a bmw on my visa card . now the payments really hurt .  Speaker2:  well , you ' re lucky that you ' re still able to make your payments . i missed a credit payment last month . now my bank account ' s overdrawn , and the company is threatening to take back my purchases . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  what did you buy ?  Speaker2:  a new home health monitor .  Speaker1:  health monitor ? i read an article about that racket . they ' re overpriced to begin with ! listen , if i were you , i ' d let them take back their monitor and spend my money on something more practical .  Speaker2:  you ' re kidding !  Speaker1:  no joke !
 | 
Speaker1: ok , ann , you spent quite a bit of time in australia recently so why don ' t you talk about that ?  Speaker2:  i really liked living in australia . i was an international student and i studied education at the university of sydney . and living in sydney was fantasticbecuase i could go to the beach anytime i wanted and there was a great nightlife in sydney . there are lots of great clubs . and people were very , very friendly and easy - going and i met a lot of international people in living sydney .  Speaker1:  mm - hm . how long were you there ?  Speaker2:  i was there for almost a year . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  oh , ok . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  and i travelled a little bit in australia . i went up the east coast . up to frasier island . which is a world heritage site . and i saw dingo running along the beach and sharks in the water . we climbed cliffs and went through a rain forest and went camping and then we went up to the . . . , which is a but north . and the further north you go in australia , the hotter it gets . so we were able to go swimming in the ocean and i went diving for the first time but it was a little bit risky cause i didn ' t have a diving license , so i went on an introductory dive and i saw a giant clam that had a really purple spongy inside that i was able to touch and then the clam closed up really quickly . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  so , did you , did you lose your finger ?  Speaker2:  almost .  Speaker1:  almost . ah , you ' re lucky . um , it ' s funny , you go in the water and you worry about sharks , but not clams .  Speaker2:  exactly .  Speaker1:  will you be going back to australia soon ?

Speaker1:  she looked sweeter than her pictures .  Speaker2:  did you take a photo with her ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  no , there were too many people . when she got out of the car , her fans were all screaming , trying to give her flowers and to get her autographs .

Speaker1: i have to go home now , jenny . thanks for inviting me to your party .
 | 
Speaker1: i was wondering how you are going to calculate our final grades .  Speaker2:  grades are based on many things  Speaker1:  what counts the most ?  Speaker2:  actually i look at all of it and let ' s not forget class participation .  Speaker1:  do you grade on a curve or use percentages ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  homework , attendance , and quizzes are sixty percent ; the mid - term and final are worth twenty percent each . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  what if we miss something ?  Speaker2:  i will allow one unexcused absence ; after that you need to contact me ahead of time .  Speaker1:  will you tell us if we are failing during the year ?

Speaker2:  a couple of days ago . i just go back from the funeral .  Speaker1:  is there anything i can do ?

Speaker2:  at least she didn ' t suffer .  Speaker1:  i think your grandmother would want you to think of all the good times you spent together .  Speaker2:  i know . but i miss her .  Speaker1:  when my grandmother passed away , i frequently visited her in the cemetery . i always talked to her . even though she wasn ' t there , i somehow knew she heard what i said . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  yeah ? that ' s what i was thinking too . thanks . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  it looks like you haven ' t eaten anything all day . we should get you something to eat .

Speaker1:  an mba , hey . . . well my degree wasn ' t in business , the business schools won ' t be interested in me .  Speaker2:  nonsense ! the business schools measure your ability through a test called gmat .  Speaker1:  gmat ? what does that stand for and what will the test contain ?  Speaker2:  graduate management admission test , it contains three parts  Speaker1:  okay , this sounds a little tough , how am i supposed to practice for this ?  Speaker2:  up to you , you could have a one on one session with a tutor or group sessions , you can also use free or private computer software . going to church might help as well !  Speaker1:  no matter what i do , i ' m going to ace this test and go on to become a corporate fat cat !

Speaker1: this is the good life ! we have it good don ’ t you think ?  Speaker2:  yeah of course ! although , don ’ t you ever wonder what could have been ?  Speaker1:  what do you mean ?  Speaker2:  well , sometimes i think of how things could have turned out if i had done things a little differently .  Speaker1:  for example ?  Speaker2:  like for example , if i hadn ’ t studied architecture , i would have become an artist like i wanted to .  Speaker1:  i see . yeah now that i think of it , i wouldn ’ t have gotten married if i hadn ’ t moved to this town and met sally .  Speaker2:  you see ! everything happens for a reason ! we wouldn ’ t even have met if i hadn ’ t been in that car accident ten years ago ! _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  well , i have no regrets !

Speaker1:  yeah , how do you know about that ?
 | 
Speaker1: if you can choose , will you marry a foreigner or a chinese ?  Speaker2:  why ? did tom pop the question ?  Speaker1:  not yet . but i wonder if i can get my parents ’ consent .  Speaker2:  let me guess , your parents want you to marry a chinese man , right ?  Speaker1:  you are right . it is giving me a real headache . i feel like i ’ m between a rock and a hard place .  Speaker2:  i used to have the same problem when i was with my ex .  Speaker1:  oh , how did you deal with it ?  Speaker2:  i just let it go and continued dating with my korean boyfriend . but finally we broke up .  Speaker1:  oh , it ’ s a pity . what was the matter ?  Speaker2:  simple . we had personality clashes and there were too many cultural differences .  Speaker1:  like what ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  he hoped to live in the korean way and asked me to give up working and stay at home to take care of the family .  Speaker1:  oh , i see . in their culture women should put family first .  Speaker2:  yes , he said it would be batter for me and for the whole family . but i simply can not quit working .  Speaker1:  so that ' s why it ’ s hard to have a happy marriage with a foreigner .
 | 
Speaker1: i don ' t know how to adjust my life . would you give me a piece of advice ?  Speaker2:  you look a bit pale , don ' t you ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  yes , i can ' t sleep well every night .  Speaker2:  you should get plenty of sleep .

Speaker2:  huh ? me ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  yeah , you . i just saw you throw a piece of garbage on the ground . can ' t you read the no littering sign ? it ' s a $ 500 penalty for littering , so go pick it up and put it in the garbage can over there .  Speaker2:  why should i do that ? it ' s only a piece of garbage . why should you care ?  Speaker1:  because this is a public place , and i want to spend my time here without having to look at your garbage .  Speaker2:  listen , i really don ' t know why you ' re making this into such a big issue . it ' s only a small piece of garbage in a large space . it ' s not like there ' s garbage everywhere . besides , someone will come along to clean it up at some time or another .  Speaker1:  it ' s not the cleaner ' s responsibility to pick up after lazy people . it ' s part of your responsibility to make sure that the place is neat for other people . if everyone thought like you , there ' d be garbage everywhere ! the cleaners can ' t be everywhere !

 | 
Speaker1: how do you feel about wearing name logos or slogans on your clothing ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  i ' ve never really thought about it before . i guess it doesn ' t bother me .  Speaker1:  do you think advertising has an influence on the choices you make when you ' re shopping ?  Speaker2:  i guess so . i usually buy name - brand clothing , shoes , and electronic goods . how about you ?  Speaker1:  i actually try to avoid name - brand items . i can ' t stand it when big companies advertise their products all over the place !  Speaker2:  i know that advertisers are experts at persuading people to spend their money , i think brilliant items are usually higher quality than ~ grounds .  Speaker1:  i think is sensible to buy products that is high quality than others when you want to buy something that ' s going to last a long time , but i don ' t think it always makes sense .  Speaker2:  do you have a brand preference for anything ?  Speaker1:  i do for shower items like shower gel and shampoo , but i don ' t for higher - end items .  Speaker2:  what do you think about the " impossible is nothing " billboard on the high street ?  Speaker1:  it ' s just a slogan for a famous company ; there ' s nothing really special about it .
 | 
Speaker1: did you see the fashion awards last night ?  Speaker2:  i sat through about half of it but they lost me after that .  Speaker1:  not interested ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  not really , to be honest . some of what they call fashion looks terrible to me .  Speaker1:  but they are showing what will be all the rage next year .  Speaker2:  all the rage with whom ? i never see anyone wearing these designs on the street . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  did you know that fashion is cyclical ?  Speaker2:  what , it keeps coming back ?  Speaker1:  precisely ! for example , flares were popular for a while , then went out of fashion . now we can start to see them coming back in again .  Speaker2:  flares ?  Speaker1:  they ' re also known as bell - bottoms . they are a type of trousers .

Speaker1:  but this is terrible . i ' m expecting important calls .  Speaker2:  about what ?  Speaker1:  you know what . the theater guild is supposed to call me and discuss a contract for my play . they are supposed to call me this evening . if i don ' t have a phone . oh , what can i do ?  Speaker2:  well , the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast .  Speaker1:  do you have a cell phone ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  no . i hate cell phones . but you could go to a neighbor ' s house and use their phone .  Speaker1:  can you drive me ? i will go to ann ' s house . it isn ' t far . i can call the theater guild from there and give them her number . she will let us wait in her living room .  Speaker2:  yes , of course i can drive you . so you don ' t want to get your phone fixed right away ?  Speaker1:  yes , i do . at ann ' s house i will call the phone company and have them check my line . if they can fix it right away without coming to my house , then we ' ll just return here . but if not , i need to wait at ann ' s house to talk with the theater guild . it ' s very important to me .

Speaker1: in spring , people are feeling refreshed . they take off their heavy winter clothes and walk with a straight back and light steps . they feel they are full of spirits and energy . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  women in particular . they are anxious to get rid of those thick and clumsy winter suits and put on their new fashionable spring dress .  Speaker1:  well , when summer comes , the weather is hot and the leaves turn darkgreen ; the sun is blazing and the air is threatening . no one would like to stay in the open air for long .  Speaker2:  that ' s true . in summer , the first place people want to go is a spacious room with air - conditioning or a quiet river or swimming pool .  Speaker1:  i myself like very much to listen to the singing of some of the insects , especially the singing of cicadas .  Speaker2:  in autumn , almost all fruits are ripe and all crops are waiting to be harvested .  Speaker1:  and you can hear singing and laughing everywhere ! people are happy in autumn because autumn brings them harvest and richness and prosperity !  Speaker2:  well , winter is a season for relaxation , do you agree with me ?  Speaker1:  well , it ' s hard to say . for the fields and rivers , winter is a relaxing season , but for farmers , i think they might take a rest physically , but mentally they are still busy thinking , planning and calculating for the working of the next year .

Speaker1: hey sarah , are you all right ? you look upset .  Speaker2:  as a matter of fact , i am a bit upset . i just came out of a meeting and it didn ' t go very well .  Speaker1:  what happened ?  Speaker2:  no one would listen to any of my suggestions . instead , they just kept arguing with each other .  Speaker1:  who was chairing the meeting ?  Speaker2:  bob .  Speaker1:  well , i can tell you from experience that bob might come off a little strong sometimes .  Speaker2:  that ' s exactly what happened ! he kept interrupting everyone with his own suggestions and did not want to hear what others had to say . then he expected everyone to agree with him .  Speaker1:  what was the meeting about ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  we were trying to come up with ideas to streamline the office ' s workflow to make it more efficient .  Speaker1:  it ' s ironic that the meeting was anything but efficient .  Speaker2:  exactly . i had tons of ideas that i wanted to share , but they just wouldn ' t let me finish . what should i have done to get my point across ?  Speaker1:  you have to keep things short and sweet . when you get a chance to speak , try not to get into too many unnecessary details .  Speaker2:  short and sweet ? but what if i have to explain something complicated ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  you can always bring up the main points during the meeting and speak to those who are directly involved after the meeting . not everyone needs to know all that information .

Speaker1: let ' s go to the cinema tonight , shall we ?  Speaker2:  good idea . is there a good movie on ?  Speaker1:  what about ' farewell my concubine ' ? i ' ve been wanting to see it for a long time . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  all right . but it ' ll be difficult to buy tickets i suppose .

 | 
Speaker1: i ’ d love to have my own farm . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  it would be very hard work . are you sure ?  Speaker1:  i wouldn ’ t mind getting up early morning and the physical work would make me fit and healthy .  Speaker2:  running a farm would be totally different to you current job .  Speaker1:  that ’ s one reason i ’ d like to try it . i ’ d really like to get away from working 9 to 5 in an office .  Speaker2:  you ’ d need a lot of training before becoming a farmer . it ’ s not something you can just walk into .  Speaker1:  my uncle owns a farm and i ’ ve spent some time working with him . i love being in the countryside with farm animals and green fields .

Speaker2:  you don ’ t have to starve yourself to lose weight . i think that ’ s where you ’ re going wrong .  Speaker1:  why ? if i eat less , then my body will start eating away at my fat reserves , right ?  Speaker2:  not really . you should try to not eat foods high in calories , salts or saturated fats . stay away from oily food and artificial flavors .  Speaker1:  so you are saying that i should eat , but i should just watch what i eat ?  Speaker2:  yes ! you can also try to reduce your intake of carbohydrates and foods that are high in cholesterol . you can have steamed veggies or increase your protein intake found in chicken or fish .  Speaker1:  if i do all this do you think i can lose twenty pounds in four weeks ?

 |

Speaker2:  it ’ s approximately 3 . 14 , but the number continues forever . what ’ s the diameter of your circle ?

Speaker2:  ok . my next problem is to convert 10000 british pounds into us dollars . what ’ s the exchange rate at the moment ?  Speaker1:  according to the newspaper , the exchange rate is 1 . 85 dollars to the pound .  Speaker2:  that means that 10 . 000 pounds will buy me 18 . 500 dollars .  Speaker1:  what ’ s the next question .  Speaker2:  fractions . what ’ s a quarter and an eighth ? that ’ s three - eights . easy . the next question is “ what are prime numbers ? ” .  Speaker1:  i can help you there . those are numbers that cannot be created by multiplying two whole numbers , apart from the number itself and 1 , together . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  so , 1 , 2 and 3 are prime numbers , but 4 isn ’ t because 2 * 2 = 4 . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  exactly . anything else ?
 |

Speaker2:  no tipping ? now that ' s what i call a civilized system . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  at hotels and some restaurants they add a service charge to the bill , but other than that , tipping isn ' t customary .  Speaker2:  what about cab drivers and porters ?  Speaker1:  in a cab you just pay what it says on the meter . i generally tip hotel porters 10 yuan per bag , but in first - class hotels they ' re instructed not to accept gratuities .

Speaker2:  sounds great to me ! if they are willing , we could ask them to go dancing with us . that is excellent exercise and fun , too . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  good . let ' s go now .

Speaker1:  really ? what about the pay rate ? are the wages pretty high ?  Speaker2:  from what i hear , they are very reasonable . a lot of the prestige the company has built is because they have attacked some high profile employees with their incentives .

Speaker1: hi , larry , how was your weekend ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  not bad . we had a get - together with friends from college . i haven ' t seen many of them since graduation . how about you ?  Speaker1:  great . i hung out with jo all day shopping , and the went out for dinner together .  Speaker2:  sounds a good weekend . you know it always amazes me that two people as different as you and jo can become such close friends .  Speaker1:  yeah , i never thought we could be good friends either . we have our differences . she ' s more outgoing and active while i am more quiet and reversed , but we still get along extremely well . we can talk for hours about anything .  Speaker2:  that ' s great . i know people who can ' t stand each other for even five minutes .  Speaker1:  when jo and i are together , we argue a lot , but that ' s also part of the fun . besides , i know she will always be there for me when i need her , and she knows i ' ll be there for her .  Speaker2:  it seems you two bring out the best of one another .  Speaker1:  exactly . having jo as my friend is one of the best things that ' s ever happened to me .

Speaker1: what ’ s the difference between football and rugby ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  those tow games are quite different . first , there ’ s the size of the teams . in football , a team has 11 players . in rugby there are 15 players on each team . the biggest difference is that in football , only the goalkeeper can use his hands . in rugby , the ball is usually carried forward by players , though kicking is permitted .  Speaker1:  in rugby , players pass the ball by throwing it to team mates , don ’ t they ?  Speaker2:  that ’ s right . however , players can only pass the ball backwards . they cannot pass the ball forwards to their team mates . that ’ s a foul .  Speaker1:  i know how goals are scored in football , but how about in rugby ?  Speaker2:  if a team carries the ball over the goal line , they score points . a team can also score points by kicking the ball between two tall posts at each end of the pitch .  Speaker1:  there ’ s a lot more physical contact in rugby , isn ’ t there ?  Speaker2:  yes . players usually need to bring a player down to stop him from moving forward with the ball . this is called ” tackling ” , as in football .  Speaker1:  the ball is a different shape in rugby , isn ’ t it ?

Speaker2:  well , i ' m not one to gossip , as you know , but rumor has it that she sued her former boss for sexual harassment .  Speaker1:  wow , crikey . so what happened ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  well , this is just between ourselves , of course , but he was her lover and he wanted to leave her , so she got revenge . i heard him say she was a dangerous woman . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  wow .  Speaker2:  oh , while we ' re on the subject , what happened to you and your secretary ?  Speaker1:  i have no idea what you ' re talking about .  Speaker2:  oh , come on . everybody knows .

Speaker1: what is the movie you saw last night ?  Speaker2:  it is a new film , ' transformer ' . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  how do you like it ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  i expected too high from that movie , but i was a bit disappointed about it .  Speaker1:  but i heard the box office rose up to 15 million in the first week .  Speaker2:  box office can ' t explain everything . i do not think it is cheerful or well - made . the plot is old and the female character is not pretty .  Speaker1:  my sister has given me two tickets for tonight . it is called ' the life of rose ' , a french movie .  Speaker2:  what ' s it about ?  Speaker1:  it tells the lifetime of a lady singer from a beggar in the street to a famous singer in the world . it is a kind of tragedy .  Speaker2:  i prefer the tragedy . it is moving and makes me ponder about my life . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  let ' s go . the time is coming .

Speaker1: how could you handle living in such a big family ? does everyone get along ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  sure . we love each other and take care of each other . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  in such a big family , there must be a head . who ' s the head of your family ?  Speaker2:  my grandpa . he has the final word about almost everything . my grandpa is “ president , ” and grandma is “ vice - president . ” my parents , uncles and aunts try to arrive at a consensus on important questions .  Speaker1:  is a family like yours common in south korea ?  Speaker2:  no . not anymore . mine is highly educated but traditional family . most south korea families today are a lot smaller . in traditional families , the old people are well respected and taken good care of . ho  Speaker1:  my family setup is a bit different . in new york city , there ' re only three people , my mother , my stepfather and me . during this summertime , i fly out to california and live with my dad . dad ' s getting  Speaker2:  of course there ' ll be a room for you !  Speaker1:  to be blunt , maybe i won ' t be able to get along with his new wife or her kids .  Speaker2:  yours is a modern family . i ' m sure your dad loves you and would want you to stay for the summer . you just need to try your best to get along with your new stepmother and her boys .  Speaker1:  but four boys !  Speaker2:  it will be a new experience , and you might as well learn to adjust to changes .  Speaker1:  you are right , i guess . the world keeps changing , and so do families . but i like a small - sized or medium - sized family where everybody is equal to everybody else . that ' s what i want .  Speaker2:  it is good to have goals in life . if california doesn ' t work out , come and visit me in korea , ok ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  that ' s a great idea !
 | 
Speaker1: hello , kate .  Speaker2:  hi , peter . i didn ' t see you last night . where did you go ?  Speaker1:  i was almost on line the whole night .  Speaker2:  did you play network games the whole night ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  no , i listened to the music , too .
 | 
Speaker1: i ' m going to have some people over for dinner saturday night . would you like to join us ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  oh , i ' m afraid i ' ll be busy tomorrow evening . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  some other time then ?

Speaker2:  don ' t mention it . it was the least i could do .  Speaker1:  if there ' s ever anything i can do for you , don ' t hesitate to let me know .  Speaker2:  thank you .  Speaker1:  i ' m most grateful .

Speaker1: you ' re acting weird tonight . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  i ' m just in the mood to act goofy . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  what brought this on ?
 | 
Speaker1: hey , mary , can you cut that out ?  Speaker2:  cut what out i ’ m not doing anything . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  the tapping of your pen on your desk . it ’ s driving me crazy .  Speaker2:  fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !  Speaker1:  i don ’ t slurp my coffee . and plus , how can you hear it when you ’ re shouting into your phone all the time ?  Speaker2:  you ’ ve got to be kidding me ! you ’ re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?  Speaker1:  look , we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions , and it ’ s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . but , it ’ s probably not a good idea to keep it up i ’ m willing to forgive and forget and if you are .
 | 
Speaker1: what do you think about all the different diets people go on ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  i don ' t think dieting is good for you . it ' s much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with !  Speaker1:  but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?  Speaker2:  they need to eat healthy foods , but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . they don ' t have to cut out fattening foods altogether , though .  Speaker1:  so you think it ' s ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate ?  Speaker2:  sure , they can eat some chocolate . as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods , there ' s nothing wrong with having a small desert .  Speaker1:  how about drinking soda ?  Speaker2:  many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be a treat ; there ' s simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . if you want to lose weight and you can ' t stop drinking soda , try  Speaker1:  that ' s good advice . have you ever tried taking vitamins ?  Speaker2:  my mother used to make me take vitamins every day , but i don ' t take them anymore . vitamins are good as a supplement , but they don ' t do much good if you don ' t have a well - balanced diet to start .  Speaker1:  how do you know so much about food and dieting ?

Speaker2:  to tell you the truth , i ' m not married . i ' m still single .  Speaker1:  then , when do you plan to get married ?
 | 
Speaker1: bob , put on your shoes , your feet are really smelly .  Speaker2:  no foot gives out scent .  Speaker1:  but don ' t forget you are in a cafe . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  never mind , the odour of my feet will quicken their eating speed .  Speaker1:  i simply can ' t bear your barbaric behavior .  Speaker2:  don ’ t pretend you are a good god .  Speaker1:  you should feel shameful for your behavior .

Speaker1:  if you can ' t give me the full amount , a fraction of it would still help . i ' ll pay you back on monday . i promise .  Speaker2:  let ' s see , i ' ve got about $ 50 to get me through the weekend . i can only spare about $ 20 . i would give you more if i had it , i just don ' t have much money to my name right now .  Speaker1:  thanks a lot ayden . every little bit will help . tell you what , if you aren ' t doing anything tonight , why don ' t you come over and have dinner at my place . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  that ' d be great . thanks ! what time should i come over ?

Speaker1: i ' m going over to the gym . i want to do some running .  Speaker2:  why don ' t you run outside ?  Speaker1:  are you kidding ? do you know how cold it is today ?  Speaker2:  yeah , i suppose . i guess it isn ' t healthy to run in this weather .  Speaker1:  no , it ' s not . not at all . i ' d probably freeze my lungs .  Speaker2:  wait for me a minute . i ' ll go over to the gym too .  Speaker1:  you ?  Speaker2:  yes , why not ? just let me get my gym clothes together .  Speaker1:  i didn ' t know you could exercise .  Speaker2:  what do you mean by that ? everyone can exercise ! _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  yeah , i know . but you ? i always thought you were only good at lifting beer bottles to your mouth .  Speaker2:  no , not at all . i was on the swimming team in high school . and i ' d like to do some weight training . they have decent equipment at that gym .  Speaker1:  you ' re going to lift weights ? hah !  Speaker2:  are you laughing at me ?  Speaker1:  i ' m sorry . i just can ' t imagine you lifting weights .  Speaker2:  maybe not . but i want to start . i need to get in shape . i feel these past couple months that my energy is low .  Speaker1:  it ' s true . if a person doesn ' t exercise , they get sluggish . that ' s why i keep running . even in the winter .  Speaker2:  so i need to do something too .  Speaker1:  but lifting weights isn ' t the best thing . you should do some kind of aerobic exercise .  Speaker2:  i know . but i want to start today with a little weight lifting . then i ' m going to buy a new swimming suit and goggles , and every other day i ' m going to go swim laps in the pool . how does that sound ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  it sounds like a good plan to me . i ' m still . . . i mean . . .

Speaker1: the boss is mad at you .

Speaker2:  is there anything as good as a hot fudge sundae ?  Speaker1:  no way ! do you have a flavors you don ' t like ?  Speaker2:  i don ' t like ice cream with too many different flavors in it .  Speaker1:  i agree with that , it just doesn ' t work for me .  Speaker2:  i saw garlic ice cream on the menu once . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  i think that would be horrible !

Speaker1: i heard that ben is forming his own band . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  it will be a rock and roll band probably . he ’ s a very good guitarist .  Speaker1:  can you play a musical instrument ? if you can , he might ask you to join the band .  Speaker2:  i can play drums , but i haven ’ t played for a while . i ’ m not sure i ’ d be good enough to play in a band .  Speaker1:  i wish i could play a musical instrument . i love music .  Speaker2:  nowadays , you can be a dj . you can mix dance music . you don ’ t need to be able to play musical instrument or sing .  Speaker1:  i ' d love to try it . but the equipment is expensive and it was still take a lot of practice .

Speaker1:  well , to be honest , nothing is more stressful than going on a business trip with our boss .  Speaker2:  i understand . the last time i went on a business trip with the boss , i didn ' t even have enough to eat !  Speaker1:  i also think the company is pretty cheap with travel expenses . i spent half of the weekend on a train ! surely they could have afforded to buy a few plane tickets !  Speaker2:  our company is quite conscious of the environmental problems that frequent flying causes .  Speaker1:  i see . well , then perhaps they could give me a few days off after a business trip . it was really tiring for me .  Speaker2:  i can ask the boss about giving you the day off today .  Speaker1:  thank you . i can ' t imagine getting much done today . i ' m just too exhausted !

Speaker1:  it ’ s a thriller . it has julia roberts playing the female lead .  Speaker2:  i like thrillers and i like julia roberts , so it might be interesting . i read a review today and the critic didn ’ t seem to be very impressed .  Speaker1:  what did the critic say ?  Speaker2:  he didn ’ t say it was bad , but he said that it wasn ’ t as good as it could have been , particularly as there were some good actors and actresses in it .  Speaker1:  the movie starts at eight o ’ clock , so we have plenty of time to eat and get ready .
 | 
Speaker1: do you have the five dollars i lent you yesterday ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  oh i forgot ! i ' ll run home real quickly and bring you the money . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  you don ' t have to go right away .

Speaker1: that looks like an interesting book .  Speaker2:  it is . it ’ s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world , with brief descriptions of how they were build , their purpose , and so on .  Speaker1:  there are the pymeids . it ’ s easy to see how they got that name ! they don ’ t have smooth sides though .  Speaker2:  they don ’ t now , but most of them did originally . there ’ s picture of the pentagon in the united states . it ’ s very distinctive with its five sides .  Speaker1:  look at that cylindrical office building . i ’ ve never been seen one that shape before .  Speaker2:  yes . usually only towers are cylindrical in shape .  Speaker1:  tv towers are usually thicker at the bottom than at the top . they ’ re not perfectly cylindrical .  Speaker2:  this is the world ’ s largest sports stadium . it ’ s a massive oval .  Speaker1:  what sports do they play there ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  it says here that it ’ s mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  is that building a perfect cube ?
 | 
Speaker1: yes , sir ?
 | 
Speaker1: are the galaxies in the universe moving through space ?  Speaker2:  no , the galaxies sit more or less passively in the space around them . but not too much . as the space between galaxies expands , it carries the galaxies further apart - like raisins in an expanding dough .  Speaker1:  but i heard that our milky way galaxy may one day collide with a neighboring galaxy . if galaxies are moving apart from each other , how can they collide ?  Speaker2:  well , the universe is a chaotic place , and the gravity from one galaxy , or from a group of galaxies , may disturb the motion of its near neighbors , causing them to collide . however , on average , when you compare two large enough chunks of space , the galaxies in one are moving away from the galaxies in the other . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  wow , you ' re really informative . thanks a lot .

Speaker1:  oh , no , get off it . it wasn ’ t such a killer class . you just have to get into it . like they say , no pain , no gain .  Speaker2:  i am wiped out . thank you . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  look , next time get yourself some comfy shoes . you ’ re gonna come back again with me , aren ’ t you ?

 | 
Speaker1: do you have much experience with kids ?  Speaker2:  yes . i have three sons . actually i also have a grandson . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  to tell you the truth , sometimes i regret having a baby so early . i have been making so many sacrifices just because my husband insisted on keeping the baby .  Speaker2:  i understand . i was in your position before . at that time i couldn ’ t depend on anyone taking care of the children for me . my husband seldom stayed at home .  Speaker1:  what about your mother ? did she help you ?  Speaker2:  yes , she did a little . but you see , americans are different from chinese . you can ’ t depend on your own mother to be a full - time babysitter . she could baby - sit only once or twice a week . that ’ s it . i had to care for them most of the time .  Speaker1:  i see . so if my little family goes to america , i would end up taking care of my child all the time . my husband would have to make the bread for us . i just don ’ t know how i would get some education and be able to get a job some day .  Speaker2:  don ’ t worry . you can take night classes . i did that when i had kids . and soon your child will be old enough to attend kindergarten . then you could find a job and work .  Speaker1:  sounds not so easy to me . when that happens , i will be too old to learn .

Speaker1:  great , do you still remember when he started his voyage ?  Speaker2:  of course , that is from 1405 to 1433 , which is in ming dynasty .  Speaker1:  good , by the way , do you finish reading the book robinson crusoe i ' ve bought for you ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  not yet , you know i have a lot of homework to do .

Speaker1:  that ' s my boy ! wait , daniel , when is pirates of the caribbean on ?

Speaker1:  and how about your spanish ?  Speaker2:  well , it ' s not as good as my french . i can speak it reasonably well , but my written spanish isn ' t very good .  Speaker1:  i see . well , we have a lot of spanish customers , but you wouldn ' t need to write any spanish here .
 | 
Speaker1: this historian is famous in the field of tang dynasty . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  so he always sits above the salt when there is a seminar about it .  Speaker1:  right , to be famous to be respectable in some way .

Speaker1:  oh , i am sorry to hear that . i did ' t know that you had split up . what happened ?  Speaker2:  it was a few things . the first thing that happened was that we were supposed to go out for a romantic dinner for our one year anniversary , but she stood me up !  Speaker1:  really ! did she tell you why she didn ' t show up ?  Speaker2:  no , but i ended up finding out later that night when i saw her drinking with another man at a club near my home !  Speaker1:  what was she thinking ? did you confront her about it when you saw her ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  i wanted to , but i knew that if i spoke to her , i ' d just blow up at her , so i decided to just go home . i called her later that the night , but she didn ' t answer the phone .  Speaker1:  i can ' t believe she would do that to you . it ' s so dishonest - and rude !  Speaker2:  i know . i still haven ' t heard from her . the good thing is that i ' m so angry with her that i don ' t feel sad about not having her around .  Speaker1:  i bet you that she regrets what she ' s done . you are such a good catch ! she really lost out , didn ' t she ?
 | 
Speaker1: how do you usually spend your leisure time ? i mean , do you have any special interests out of your job ?  Speaker2:  of course . you see , almost everyone has some kind of hobby . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  yeah , you ’ re quite right and what ’ s your hobby ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  i like taking photos out of doors .  Speaker1:  oh , photography , it ’ s really a good hobby .  Speaker2:  yes , i usually develop and print all my own photos . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  you yourself have a photo studio ?
 | 
Speaker1: have we handed out all the water ?  Speaker2:  yes . so what else to do now ?  Speaker1:  nothing . the teacher said the only thing left was to get back all the disposable cups later .  Speaker2:  i see . how do you like the game ?  Speaker1:  terrific . there is one girl said , it is the best game i ' ve ever watched .  Speaker2:  who do you think do better ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  clive was really outstanding . not only he put on a big show himself , but also he inspired the whole team .  Speaker2:  exactly . he is unbelievable .  Speaker1:  on the other hand , i think the other team won everyone ' s respect . the leader said they could have crumpled at the beginning , but they just carried on and never lost their cool .  Speaker2:  they were really tough .  Speaker1:  the thing i like most about them is that they did not play with a heavy heart even though at that time the odds seemed to be against them .

Speaker1: hi ! what are you watching ?  Speaker2:  it ’ s a program about islam . it ’ s very interesting .  Speaker1:  wow ! so many people ! where are they and what are they doing ?  Speaker2:  they are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . muslims call this pilgrimage “ haj ” .  Speaker1:  why do they go there ?  Speaker2:  muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith .  Speaker1:  when muslims pray , they face towards mecca . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  that ’ s right . unfortunately , so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed .  Speaker1:  i heard about that . the pilgrims must walk around a large , sacred black stone .  Speaker2:  that ’ s right . that ’ s when accidents often happen . the saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims , to reduce the chances of accidents .  Speaker1:  pilgrimages are common in many faiths .  Speaker2:  yes . in england , christian pilgrims might go to canterbury and many christians go to the vatican on pilgrimages .  Speaker1:  isn ’ t there a place in france where people go to get healed ?  Speaker2:  i think that place is lourdes . there are many stories of people being healed after visiting there . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  do you think that there is something magical about that place ?

Speaker1:  do you feel your english is good enough for the course ?  Speaker2:  yes . you know , english is my present working language . besides , i scored very high in toefl .  Speaker1:  who will be your supporter during your stay in the states ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  i will support myself . in recent years , i have saved enough money for my study in the u . s . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  how long do you expect to stay there ?
 | 
Speaker1: i don ' t know what to say . this can ' t be happening . here ' s the obituary . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  it ' s really there ? this all seems so surreal - like it ' s all one big nightmare .  Speaker1:  but it explains why taylor isn ' t answering and femi took time off from work .  Speaker2:  poor femi . taylor ' s death must have made her realize that she still cared for him . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  this says the viewing is at myers funeral home today until five .

Speaker1: the spring festival is drawing close . by then we will have five days off . i am expecting it .  Speaker2:  can you tell me something about the spring festival ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  just like you celebrate christmas , we celebrate our lunar new year ' s day , the spring festival . it is a time for the family members and relatives to have a get - together .  Speaker2:  christmas is also a special time for us to have the family reunion and to express our best wishes to those we love and those who love us in the coming new year .  Speaker1:  christmas has more religious nature , while our spring festival is a more traditional holiday . on the new year ' s eve , we have a big dinner called ' family reunion dinner ' . one of the traditional food to eat at the dinner is dumplings . after that , the adults usually sit chatting , watching tv , or playing cards .  Speaker2:  what are the children doing ?  Speaker1:  they usually go outside to play firecrackers and fireworks .  Speaker2:  i heard one of the purposes to do it is to frighten the devils so they will not come to do any harm to people in the next year .  Speaker1:  perhaps it is like what people told you . at 24 hours midnight , the time when the new year really comes , we exchange ' happy new year ' to each other , and parents and grandparents will take out small packages wrapped with red paper , in them are some what we call ' lucky money .
 | 
Speaker1: we ’ re going to the movies . will you join us ?  Speaker2:  i ’ m very sorry i can ’ t .  Speaker1:  why not ?  Speaker2:  i ’ m afraid i have some business to attend to .

Speaker2:  no , thanks . his home is not far and i can walk there . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  come on . it ’ s no trouble at all .

Speaker2:  you do know that it ' s absolutely freezing out , don ' t you ? i ' d put a coat on if i were you .  Speaker1:  it wasn ' t cold out this morning .  Speaker2:  well , it ' s started raining since then . look out the window ! it ' s pouring rain out there !  Speaker1:  well , i guess we ' d better grab our umbrellas then , as well .  Speaker2:  have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?  Speaker1:  it does , actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .  Speaker2:  that ' s a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail doesn ' t dent it .  Speaker1:  ok . i ' ll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it ' s a bit chilly in here .  Speaker2:  how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?  Speaker1:  i don ' t know . the weatherman didn ' t say anything about this in his weather report last night .  Speaker2:  maybe we should turn on the news in case it ' s supposed to get worse .  Speaker1:  i don ' t think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  good idea . that will help us to warm up . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  if i ' m not back in ten minutes , come and find me .

Speaker1: at the beijing olympics , all four table tennis events were all - chinese finals . a clean sweep again ! _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  yes . all international ping - pong tournaments have become a demonstration of chinese supremacy in the sport .  Speaker1:  do you know any secrets to china ' s success ?  Speaker2:  in the first place , i think the whole nation is just fond of the game . it is well grounded with the mass . with huge numbers of people playing ping - pong , we can always spot a handful of potential world champions .  Speaker1:  so , the national ping - pong team must be a highly competitive membership .  Speaker2:  sure . there is a careful mechanism for selecting players from provincial teams , and those lucky dogs have to observe strict rules . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  for example ?  Speaker2:  they are subject to hard training . and you know what , for a player on the national team , personal affairs are supposed to take a back seat to training and competitions . they are not even allowed to talk relationships with each other .  Speaker1:  oh , dear ! it ' s an encroachment on individual rights !

Speaker1: i can ’ t believe my english teacher is making me read pride and prejudice !  Speaker2:  why not ! it ’ s a classic . in fact , it ’ s one of my favorite novels .  Speaker1:  but it ’ s so old .  Speaker2:  don ’ t judge a book by its cover . do you kwon what it ’ s about ?  Speaker1:  no , not at all .  Speaker2:  first of all , it ’ s a romance novel , set in the early 19th century .  Speaker1:  i didn ’ t realize it was a romance novel . what ’ s the main storyline ?  Speaker2:  it ’ s basically about a father who tried to marry off one of his five girls .  Speaker1:  why does he want to do that ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  since he doesn ’ t have a son , he hopes that one of the girls will marry a wealthy man . that way , all of his daughters will be cared for .  Speaker1:  won ’ t they get his inheritance ?  Speaker2:  no , that ’ s the problem . though they are well - off , once he dies , his house will go to his cousin . so , when he dies , the girls will have nothing .  Speaker1:  i see . this sounds interesting ! maybe my teacher isn ’ t so horrible after all .  Speaker2:  so , are you going to read the novel or watch the movie ?  Speaker1:  there ’ s movie ? my teacher didn ’ t tell me that !  Speaker2:  that ’ s probably because she wants you to read the book first . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  it would take a lot less time . . .

Speaker1:  you know why fire crackers are set off in festival .  Speaker2:  why ? to welcome the new year of course .  Speaker1:  and also to frighten away evil spirits .  Speaker2:  really ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  and my parents say the whole year will be as good or as bad as new year day itself and bad or rude words on the day will bring a bad year .

Speaker1: thanks for inviting me to your friend ’ s wedding . i was surprised to hear the bride and groom talking to each other that way during the marriage ceremony . is that common ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  well , some people use a standard set of words , but many couples today write their own wedding vows .  Speaker1:  your tradition of throwing rice as they got into their car was interesting , but it didn ' t look like real rice to me .  Speaker2:  it wasn ' t . it was birdseed . we don ' t throw rice anymore because someone discovered that birds come along and eat the rice and have trouble digesting it .  Speaker1:  oh , i didn ' t think of that . well , this reception reminds me of weddingparties back in china . plenty of food and drink , music and dancing , and interesting traditions .  Speaker2:  wait until you see what happens next ! the bride is getting ready to throw her bouquet . let ' s go over and watch .  Speaker1:  she ’ s got quite a crowd around her . oh , look ! that little girl caught it !

Speaker1: so , monica , what do you feel like doing this afternoon ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  actually , i had a perfect plan for this afternoon , but it is totally ruined by the sand storm . i woke up this morning and found it was sunny . so i called lucy and asked her to go shopping with me . we were going to look for a new purse . now it turned out to be like this . neither of us wants to go to outside anymore .  Speaker1:  that ’ s too bad . i hate sand storms too . it can be worse than any kind of bad weather .  Speaker2:  what ’ s wrong with climate ? anyway , i think the sand storm happens more frequently these days than the years before . can ’ t people do something to stop it ?  Speaker1:  it is not an easy job . the government is working on it . lots of trees have been planted in the north of the capital . also , methods of generating rain are being used by the government to fight against the drought . but of course , it will not work overnight . so , have you come out with a new plan for today ?

Speaker1: i never understand why these shops have so much liquor . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  what do you mean ? it ' s because it ' s much cheaper to buy liquor duty - free .  Speaker1:  but why ? why don ' t people like to buy shirts duty - free ? or shoes ? i just don ' t understand why it ' s always liquor .  Speaker2:  well , it ' s because in most countries liquor has a higher tax on it .  Speaker1:  you mean liquor has a higher tax than other things ?  Speaker2:  yes , of course . didn ' t you know that ?  Speaker1:  no , i didn ' t . how high is the tax ?  Speaker2:  well , it is different in different countries . but it ' s because of the high tax that buying liquor duty - free is such a good deal .  Speaker1:  why would the government want to tax liquor so much ?  Speaker2:  liquor is considered a luxury item . and also , it is considered as something that isn ' t very healthy . so if people want to buy it , the government thinks it has the right to tax it .  Speaker1:  that ' s why a lot of people buy cigarettes here too , isn ' t it ?

Speaker2:  well , what did you get in english 101 last year ?  Speaker1:  i got a 4 . 0 in that class . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  well , i can ' t compare to you . i got a 3 . 1 in english 101 . that means if you got a lower grade in english 201 , it must be harder .  Speaker1:  it ' s not what it appears . i actually tried harder in the 101 class . if i put as much effort into the 201 class , i would have received the same grade .

Speaker1: people are funny . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  they sure are . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  did you hear about the pilot ?  Speaker2:  the one that stole a small plane ?

Speaker1: did you watch the premiership last night ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  yes , i watched united play chelsea . what a fierce battle ! allay were engaged in intensive pressing and tackling in midfield . well , it was not like a normal english league match .  Speaker1:  no , it wasn ' t . rather , it looked like a bundesliga match , where physical contact is so frequent . english league teams are apt to pass the midfield quickly with long passes . it seems to me english soccer players are very gentlemanly . as diego maradona spoke teasingly , they often knew only chasing hard after the ball , but forgot to steal it .  Speaker2:  haha . that ' s probably why slide tackle and fouls are less common , and offsides more frequent in english league matches than those on the continent . and the ball is often kept flying overhead , drawing beautiful curves in the sky . such games are quite pleasing to the eye . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  which team do you back then ?

Speaker1: what kind of jobs are becoming popular in your country ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  as in many countries , there ’ s been a big growth in anything related to computers . young people are attracted to that field in particular . there ’ s also been a big growth in education .  Speaker1:  there ’ s been a growth in that field in my country too . a lot of people want to learn practical and professional skills .  Speaker2:  the interesting thing is that many of the teachers are not actually trained teachers . they are usually professionals who are taking a break from their jobs to pass on skills to others .  Speaker1:  i noticed that too . what are the people learning ?  Speaker2:  in my country , they are usually studying something business - related , such as marketing , management techniques , and human resource management .  Speaker1:  i think that jobs in the leisure industry will become more popular in the future .  Speaker2:  that trend has already begun in my country . in particular , there ’ s a big demand for people to work in fitness centers . which kinds of jobs are less in demand ?  Speaker1:  those in traditional fields , such as agriculture and heavy industry . younger people are not interested in doing those jobs and other countries have industries that can produce things much cheaper .

Speaker1: are you good at making decisions ?  Speaker2:  not really . sometimes , i even let other people make key decision for me .  Speaker1:  what kinds of decisions do you leave to other people ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  there are basic decisions like which restaurant to go to . i can never seem to choose . i let my parents make big decisions for me . they chose my university and my course . i ended up studying something  Speaker1:  your parents will be choosing your girlfriend if you aren ’ t careful ! why don ’ t you try being more decisive ? start with some basic ones . when your friends are discussing which restaurant to eat at , mak  Speaker2:  that ’ s a good idea . you ’ re very decisive , i ’ ve noticed . so , which bar are we going to this evening ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  i can ’ t make a decision . you ’ ll have to put forward an idea .

Speaker1: i ' ve got to put together a sales pitch to give to our clients in the morning . you always give such amazing presentations , i was hoping you could give me some advice about how to win them over tomorrow . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  sure , it ' s easy . first of all , the secret to a successful oral presentation is to keep things simple . people are listening and they usually don ' t have a long attention spans . stick to about three or four points , give an overview of the points , then present them one by one , and then summarize at the end . be straightforward and organized and you ' re sure to be remembered .  Speaker1:  what kind of visuals should i use to support the presentation ? do you think i should use powerpoint ?  Speaker2:  you should consider the size and interests of your audience . in other words , who is listening , and what do they want to hear . . . you can put together a ppt with some graphics and animations that will catch people ' s attention , but be careful not to go overboard .  Speaker1:  i think i can put something together , no problem . but when it comes to tomorrow , i ' ll just be a bundle of nerves ! how can i get over my fear of speaking in public ?

Speaker1: hey , shirley ! want to join me for lunch . . . my treat ! _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  wow ! sure ! _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  i must confess i have an ulterior motive for asking you to lunch .  Speaker2:  oh . . . that ' s ok . . . as long as you ' re buying !  Speaker1:  i really want to pick your brain about something i ' ve been thinking a lot about .  Speaker2:  i ' d love to help if i can .  Speaker1:  well , as you know , i have a bachelor ' s degree in english literature and that ' s served me well so far , but i ' ve always wanted to do some post - graduate work . . . maybe even get a doctorate !  Speaker2:  wow ! just the idea of going back to school fills my head with pain .  Speaker1:  but you have a master ' s degree . . . hasn ' t that helped your career ?  Speaker2:  yeah , i ' d have to say it has . but i ' m still paying for it , you know .  Speaker1:  i know education is expensive , but it ' s been my lifelong dream . call me crazy , but i ' ve always wanted to have that phd at the end of my name .  Speaker2:  well , getting a doctorate degree would mean close to a decade of school . can you afford that ? can you survive that ?  Speaker1:  i certainly can ' t afford it , but i ' m sure i could find some good student loans .  Speaker2:  i think you need to separate the dream of having a phd from the reality of years of more schooling . it ' s not as romantic as you might think .  Speaker1:  yeah . . . i keep thinking about what i ' ll do with a master ' s or doctorate . i love language but i don ' t think there are a lot of well - paying jobs out there for experts on shakespeare .

Speaker1:  but you ’ re in china . are you planning on going home for christmas ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  yeah , so i have to buy presents for everyone before i leave .  Speaker1:  why not just give them money in red envelopes ? that would be much easier .  Speaker2:  americans don ’ t like giving money , they prefer presents you buy for them . so i have to figure out what to buy for all of my family and friends .  Speaker1:  i ' ve got it . i won ’ t bother you any more . you ’ d better hurry to do it , christmas is just around the corner .

Speaker2:  well , sometimes i think of how things could have turned out if i had done things a little differently .  Speaker1:  for example ?  Speaker2:  like for example , if i hadn ’ t studied architecture , i would have become an artist like i wanted to .  Speaker1:  i see . yeah now that i think of it , i wouldn ’ t have gotten married if i hadn ’ t moved to this town and met sally .  Speaker2:  you see ! everything happens for a reason ! we wouldn ’ t even have met if i hadn ’ t been in that car accident ten years ago ! _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  well , i have no regrets !

Speaker1:  yes , she said they couldn ' t communicate well with each other and they often argued over trivial things .  Speaker2:  yeah . mixed marriage is tempting but crisis - ridden .  Speaker1:  you said it . you know , they fall in love at first sight and quickly jumped into marriage .  Speaker2:  maybe they were just attracted to each other but too different to be married .  Speaker1:  yeah . we chinese have quite different lifestyles and values from foreigners .  Speaker2:  definitely . that ' s why many cross - cultural marriages end in divorce .  Speaker1:  we ' ve heard so much about chinese film stars divorcing foreigners .

Speaker2:  that ' s great , that ' s good for a positive work environment and helps motivate employees . i wish my boss was like that .

Speaker1: i would love to be famous and have thousands of adoring fans . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  really ? i ’ m not sure that i would like all the attention . there have been numerous cases of paparazzi interfering with star ’ s private live in recent years .  Speaker1:  i love being photographed ! if i were famous , i ’ d do interviews for all the top magazines , like cosmo and elle .  Speaker2:  i wouldn ’ t mind having my photo taken a few times or being interviewed once or twice , but it would get tedious after a while . imagine the things the gossip columnists would write about you .  Speaker1:  no - one really believes gossip columnists .  Speaker2:  i think you ’ ll find that many people believe what they read in gossip columns . you ’ d also have to be very careful about every word you said . if you appeared on a chat show and said something silly , it  Speaker1:  i think you ’ re right about that . i ’ d need a good manager to be my spokesperson . i could do a lot of charity work , which would help a lot of people .  Speaker2:  that ’ s a great idea . which charities would you support ?  Speaker1:  i love children , as you know , so probably a children ’ s charity .
 |

Speaker1:  mendy ? are you sure ? i love her songs !  Speaker2:  me too . she is so young and talented . she is not only a singer but also a great composer herself .  Speaker1:  yeah . though she was so popular , i heard she managed to maintain a low profile .  Speaker2:  she is a real star . not a onetime thing .  Speaker1:  but i also heard some people didn ' t like her music . i don ' t understand why . she is so amazing !  Speaker2:  well , i suppose people have different tastes on music . moreover , here stuff is really strong and creative . it takes time for people to accept new things .  Speaker1:  you are right . anyway , things will be different as the days go on . she can get it . i have faith in her .  Speaker2:  sure . that makes a good fan . do you know what songs she is gonna sing tonight ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  here is the programme . check it out yourself !

 | 
Speaker1: lester , you are really fantastic at automobile repair . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  thanks , june . but i think i need to be certified as a mechanic 5 before i ’ m allowed to repair cars for a living .  Speaker1:  that ’ s not a big problem . there are many small schools for adults like you who can study to be certified . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  i guess i never thought of that before .  Speaker1:  and you can easily get a student loan from a vocational school , or from the government .
 | 
Speaker1: how is the college search going ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  it ' s a huge headache . i have no idea what i want to do .  Speaker1:  but don ' t you want to study music ? shouldn ' t it be easy ?  Speaker2:  it should be , but there are too many options . my grades are good enough that i have a lot of choices , but after that . . .  Speaker1:  i know . you have to decide if you want to attend a school in a city or in the country , a big school or a small school , a public or private school . . .  Speaker2:  yup , you understand . and my parents are trying to pressure me into going to a catholic college . they both attended one and think that it combines a good education with good discipline . and the tuition is usually pretty low .  Speaker1:  i see . well , don ' t forget to talk to the college counselor at the school . he usually gives good advice and can help point you in the right direction . he gave me some information , and next week i ' m going to take a look at some of the colleges he recommended .
 | 
Speaker1: i seldom heard the quarreling of her children .  Speaker2:  why do you say that ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  because her children have been the age when they seem to quarrel all day long .
 | 
Speaker1: i haven ' t met you at the gym for a long time . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  yeah , i quit my job , and started working from home . recently i ' ve got a project to deal with and don ' t have much time to work out .  Speaker1:  why ? you have a decent salary , lots of promotion opportunities and a regular life of going to the office at 9 o ' clock and coming back home at 5 in the evening .  Speaker2:  it ' s not about pay raise or promotion . you know , i hate getting up early in the morning and coming back home late at night .  Speaker1:  then soho is your ideal work style .  Speaker2:  yeah , as long as i have a computer and internet access , i can start working . i recently enjoy working in my own place and at my own pace .  Speaker1:  and you don ' t have to work under that much pressure and control .  Speaker2:  absolutely . i can decide when and what to do all by myself .  Speaker1:  sounds great . are there many business opportunity ?  Speaker2:  yeah , i can find enough online .  Speaker1:  it ' s good to have business around . but you should also do some exercise to keep fit .
 | 
Speaker1: what did you say when she told you the news ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  i calmed up . and finally , i asked her to chew the cud for such an important decision . i could not have the heart to disappoint her with a blunt refusal . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  but i put my foot down and insisted on her forgetting that .

Speaker2:  i ' ve got it . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  thank you . now i see that you are my true friend . most of my so - called friends left me at the moment my company went bankrupt . you are the only one who has stood by me the whole time .  Speaker2:  i am just doing what i think i should do .  Speaker1:  thank you for being a friend of mine .

Speaker1:  absolutely ! i don ' t think any planes are going anywhere . the sand being blown around has cut visibility in beijing to less than 100 meters . but inseems gansu province is being hit the hardest .

Speaker1: hey , jenny . would you like to go to dinner with me ?  Speaker2:  i don ' t know . you know what they say about office romances .  Speaker1:  no , i don ' t . what do they say about office romances ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  they say you shouldn ' t mix love and work .  Speaker1:  that ' s silly . what i do on my own time is no one else ’ s business . besides , it ' s pretty hard to meet people outside of the office when we spend long hours here .  Speaker2:  you ’ ve got a point . once i dated one of my supervisors and all of my co - workers accused him of favoritism . then when the relationship went bad , he fired me .  Speaker1:  people fall in love with people they work with . that ' s a fact .  Speaker2:  that may be true , but i don ' t want an inter - office relationship to affect my productivity .  Speaker1:  if it does , it will only make you more productive , because we can support each other .  Speaker2:  you are sounding like we are already married .  Speaker1:  good grief . all i did was ask you out . i am sorry .  Speaker2:  well , i don ' t feel right about it .  Speaker1:  i am talking about dinner tonight , not a lifetime .

Speaker1: welcome back movie lovers to another premier movie review . my name is richard clarke and i am joined today by the very erudite davidwatson . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  thank you dick . today we are going to talk about the movie lion king . tell me dave , what is your impression of this film ?  Speaker1:  well , i think this film is simply a fable , depicting man ’ s eternal greed for power , and in my opinion , it ’ s a very fine film . even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries . the musical score was amazing , the animation was very well done , and the story was simply enchanting .  Speaker2:  i think otherwise . even though the animation was technically strong , and as you say , the score and songs performed by elton john were great , the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart . and i would dare to say , it was too predictable .  Speaker1:  predictable ! how ! come on dick , it ’ s a g - rated movie ! it ’ s for the kids ! it ’ s not a thriller !  Speaker2:  well , that ’ s just it . it did have some very dramatic and intense scenes for example when mufasal dies , or the dark , grim portrayal of scar . even so , the film is linear . mufasal dies , simba runs away thinking it ’ s his fault . falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his . it ’ s just too cliche .  Speaker1:  how can it be cliche ? it ’ s a fable ! it ’ s telling a time - honoured story ! the movie make a point of how the hunger for power leads to corruption , and teaches children the value of respect , life and love .  Speaker2:  you have always been so soft , dave ! _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  open your heart dick . don ’ t shut us out .

Speaker1:  that ' s tough . what does your wife think about this ?  Speaker2:  she ' s trying to be supportive , but i can tell she is very worried about our financial situation as well .  Speaker1:  i have some friends who might be able to help you find a job . i ' ll see what they can do .

 | 
Speaker1: alright everyone settle down . let ’ s get started . as you know , an important aspect of becoming a good citizen is understanding the genesis of our legal system . it is not enough to simply memorize our laws , it is necessary that we comprehend why and how they were formed . this brings me to our topic for today . does anyone know what we celebrate on may first ?  Speaker2:  cinct de mayo ?  Speaker1:  no , that ’ s may fifth in spanish , james , no wonder you are failing my spanish class . no , may first is international workers ’ day .  Speaker2:  do we get a day off from school then ?  Speaker1:  no ! it is not considered to be a national holiday here in the us , but in other countries it is .  Speaker2:  www , man ! _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  in the nineteenth century , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , and fourteen hours a day . support for the eight - hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by april 1886 , 250 , 000 workers were involved in the may day movement . previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . they passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ’ s work . and , on may first 1886 , the resolution took effect .  Speaker2:  cool ! is that why we only work eight hours now ?  Speaker1:  yes ! but the happy ending came at a high price . on may third , 1886 , police fired into a crowd of strikers at the mccormick reaper works factory , killing four and wounding many . a mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality .

Speaker1:  yes . you need to be careful with what you eat when you ' re abroad . sometimes new food might disagree with you .  Speaker2:  on the fourth day , we went to taste the french cuisine . that was really fantastic . and no stomach problems .  Speaker1:  that is great . everyone says french food is wonderful .

Speaker1:  well , you can simply tell them you want to sleep , or make an arrangement for a time when the room should quiet down .

Speaker2:  well , first of all , it needs a new engine , which is extremely expensive .  Speaker1:  when ' s the last time you had it serviced ?  Speaker2:  it must have been a few years ago now .  Speaker1:  i thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis .  Speaker2:  they do . once my son was born , there was no reason to drive this car anymore . it ' s only a two - seater , you know !  Speaker1:  what else is wrong with it ?  Speaker2:  the heating controls don ' t work anymore , so it always feels like it ' s about 100 degrees in the car — even in the summer !  Speaker1:  anything else ?  Speaker2:  the brakes don ' t really work that well anymore either .  Speaker1:  why don ' t you get it all fixed ?

Speaker2:  better or worse , it doesn ' t matter . i had a lot of feelings for him . i really liked him  Speaker1:  it must be really painful . i remember when josh and i broke up . i was crying for a week .

Speaker1: i watched a very interesting documentary about plants yesterday evening . it was called “ unusual plants ” and looked at several species of plants from around the world which have unusual features .  Speaker2:  really ? tell me about some of the plants they showed .  Speaker1:  well . there was one type of plant that catches insects and eats them .  Speaker2:  is that type of plant found in this country ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  no , it isn ’ t . it ’ s a pity , because i ’ d like to see it in action .  Speaker2:  so would i . what other unusual plants did they show ?  Speaker1:  they showed flowers that only provide their nectar to one type of butterfly or bee . the insect has to be the exact size to get the nectar . other insects cannot get it . of course , when the insect collects the nectar , it also takes some pollen from one flower to another .  Speaker2:  that ’ s very specialized . so , the insects and the flowers rely on each other . if one became extinct , the other would too .  Speaker1:  that ’ s right . that ’ s one reason why it ’ s so important to protect every species .  Speaker2:  i see . the plants that fascinate me most are cacti . i find it amazing that they can survive in such dry desert conditions .  Speaker1:  according to the documentary , they have an incredible ability to find water supplies , however small , and then store them without losing much through evaporation .

 | 
Speaker1: how do i apply to an american university ?  Speaker2:  you should go to the library to find some information about american universities , and write to the admission office . then the admission office will send you application forms and other related materials . from experience , many applicants write to several universities instead of just one .  Speaker1:  i was told that it took a lot of time and effort to apply .  Speaker2:  that is true . i ' ll list for you the requirements of almost all the universities . first of all , you need official transcripts of your undergraduate work , three letters of recommendation from your professors who know your competence , and the official toefl ( test of english as a foreign language ) score ( it ' s usually 550 ) . then you need a financial guarantee , and an application fee of 25 dollars .  Speaker1:  what ' s to come next ?  Speaker2:  if they agree to enroll you , they will send you a tap - 66 form . with tap - 66 , you can apply for a passport from our government , and then apply for a visa from the us embassy in beijing .  Speaker1:  how long will it take to go over all the procedures ?  Speaker2:  from 3 to 6 months if everything goes well . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  thank you . i appreciate all your help .

Speaker1:  do you ever get lonely living alone ?
 | 
Speaker1: do you have any plans for veteran ’ s day ?  Speaker2:  you mean armistice day . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  well , as you know , on november 11th the allies signed a peace treaty with the germans , also known as the armistice treaty . this marked the end of wwi and many countries around the world commemorate this date under names such as remembers ’ day . in poland it ’ s their independence day ! there ’ s a lot going on around the world on this day .
 | 
Speaker1: are you sure you heard right ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  yes , he is running for class president . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  i don ' t believe you .
 | 
Speaker1: these days my son has turned his computer into an electronic playground . he plays football , rides horses , drives racing cars , and does a whole bunch of other things on the computer . the funny thing about it is that , no matter what he plays , he always wins first place . i wonder if he ' ll be able to cope with a defeat in real life . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  don ' t worry . he ' ll cross that bridge when he comes to it . my son reads a lot on his computer and uses e - mail to send messages to his friends almost every day . he ' s really absorbed by the discussions .  Speaker1:  that ' s exactly like my wife . she spends at least two hours a day on the computers discussing things ranging from stock prices to soft - ware standards .

Speaker2:  haven ' t the olympics been stopped for a long time ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  yes , there were no games in 1916 , 1940 and 1944 , because of world war i and world war ii .  Speaker2:  i see . look , do you know what that emblem means ? i ' ve seen it so many times , but i don ' t know what it stands for .  Speaker1:  oh , it ' s the beijing 2008 olympics ' emblem . it ' s a chinese seal , meaning that chinese people warmly welcome the friends from all over the world .

Speaker2:  what did you do ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  i talked to her for a while , but she ’ s really depressed . so , i made an appointment with the school counselor for her .  Speaker2:  that ’ s a good idea . the counselor is a psychologist . he ’ s better trained to handle these sorts of things .  Speaker1:  yeah , that ’ s what i told her . i ’ m glad she ’ s reaching out for help , instead of trying to deal with this on her own .
 | 
Speaker1: it ’ s rather cold . isn ’ t it  Speaker2:  oh . yes . it is  Speaker1:  shall i light the stove ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  that ’ s a good idea _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  well . what ’ s the climate like in your country ?

Speaker2:  how many did you use to take ?  Speaker1:  three every night .  Speaker2:  good heavens . why did you take so many ?

Speaker1: do you think discrimination against women in the work force is still prevalent even today ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  from my own experience as a career woman , i would have to say that while things are getting better now than they used to be , it is still a widespread problem . society is changing , but there is still a glass ceiling for women in many career tracks .  Speaker1:  do you think the glass ceiling phenomena is because of traditional social customs ? or are there more issues coming into play ?  Speaker2:  i think it ' s a very complicated issue . a part of the difficulties women have advancing in the work force are due to few opportunities and many male managers . don ' t underestimate the good ole ' boy system . men have power , so it ' s easier for them to stay in power . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  what about affirmative action ? hasn ' t legislation changed a lot of the make hierarchy ?

Speaker2:  all right , we are here at the eighth hole . it ’ s a par four , and has some very difficult hazards which many golfers find difficult to avoid . although , i did see jack nicklaus hit a hole in one on this very same hole !  Speaker1:  tiger woods is about to tee off , and let ’ s see if he has the same luck as jack . tiger is asking his caddie for his driver and , he seems to be very nervous .  Speaker2:  oh no ! not a good swing at all ! it ’ s definitely not his day today . on the seventh hole he got a bogey and before that he barely made par . he will definitely not get a birdie on this shot .  Speaker1:  it seems that his ball has flown somewhere deep in the trees . he is having a hard time finding it and even his caddie has climbed a tree to try and spot it .

Speaker2:  i think the government fined him a small amount , and he kept the rest in his foreign bank accounts . he ’ s still a millionaire .  Speaker1:  that ’ s the kind of thing in america that gets me mad . some guy pulls off a stock scheme and makes millions while spending the bare minimum sentence in jail .

Speaker1:  do you think that there ' s life on other planets ?  Speaker2:  i think there must be .  Speaker1:  why is that ?

Speaker1:  let ' s make it the first item of business in our next meeting . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  we should probably let everyone know ahead of time so they will be prepared . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  can you take care of sending out a bulletin by e - mail to all the club members ?

Speaker2:  i need to improve my english .  Speaker1:  do you want a one - to - one private tutor or a group class ?  Speaker2:  i think a one - to - one course will be too expensive for me , so a group class would be fine .  Speaker1:  have you ever considered taking one of our online courses ?  Speaker2:  i think i prefer face - to - face instruction better .  Speaker1:  that ' s fine . if you want , you can sign up for a pre - sessional interview .  Speaker2:  what ' s that for ?  Speaker1:  one of our qualified teachers will interview you so that they can find a class that suits you best .  Speaker2:  do you have a brochure about the course that i can take home to read ?

Speaker1:  me ? i ’ m even less experienced than you are .  Speaker2:  at least you know what american women generally like in a man .  Speaker1:  believe it or not , i guess american women like a man in good shape , which chinese women may not care about so much . that ’ s my honest opinion . i know you have been trying very hard .  Speaker2:  american men are naturally taller than chinese men . so even if i exercise , there aren ’ t many chances .  Speaker1:  no , that ’ s not true . i ’ ve met two american women who were married to chinese . but those chinese look very strong and healthy . so if you exercise more often , i bet it will surely be easier for you to date american girls . how old is jacky chan ? he ’ s small and short . but i bet he can have any american woman he wants .
 | 
Speaker1: who is it ?  Speaker2:  open the door . it ' s me . i can ' t find the key . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  you ' re always so careless .

Speaker1:  i don ’ t believe that . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  and in my opinion , medicine is making us healthier .  Speaker1:  i agree with you in the sense . but we ’ re all more miserable than ever , aren ’ t we ?
 |

Speaker1:  yes , now many girls want to be independent , so it is a little popular , especially among white collars .  Speaker2:  but i am still traditional , so i felt weird when she paid for herself . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  forget about it !
 | 
Speaker1: you ’ re going to set up your own law office , aren ’ t you ?  Speaker2:  yes . after so many years of hard work , i ’ d rather i had an office of my own .

Speaker1:  i ’ d like to wish you every success in your new venture .

 | 
Speaker1: wasn ' t that a great flick ? i was on the edge of my seat through the whole movie . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  i would say it was a typical run - of - the - mill hollywood thriller .  Speaker1:  well , i ' m no movie expert , but those special effects were impressive by any standards .  Speaker2:  special effects ? baloney ! that movie was made on a shoestring budget . they ' ve been using trick photography like that for years  Speaker1:  okay . but you have to admit that it was an exciting story , especially with that surprise ending .  Speaker2:  you should read the book . the original story is much better and has a different twist at the end . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  oh , really ? how does the book end ?
 | 
Speaker1: do you know the highest mountain in the world ?  Speaker2:  yes . it is everest , also called zhumulangma in china . it is 8 , 844 . 43 meters above the sea level . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  wow ! that must be really awesome to stand on the top of the mountain to overlook the earth .  Speaker2:  actually , it is impossible because the mountain is covered with snow all year around . and is has heavy fog for most of the time . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  have people set foot on its peak ?

Speaker1: mr . keller , may i call at your home sometime the week ?  Speaker2:  oh , certainly . when would you like to come ?  Speaker1:  well , when will it be convenient for you ?
 | 
Speaker1: i don ' t know how they do it ! our competitors have undercut us by 10 % percent on the price of our latest model . there is no way will be able to compete against that . we ' re barely breaking even with the present prices . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  these price wars are disastrous for our bottom line . if they ' re charging 10 % less than we are , we ' ve got to find a way to lower our price while keeping our profit .  Speaker1:  profits are almost nonexistent now , we can ' t beat their price . how do they keep their price so low ?

Speaker2:  we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks , but apart from that , summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again , so most people don ’ t mind then .  Speaker1:  what are spring and autumn like ?  Speaker2:  i like spring because flowers bloom and trees grow leaves again . in spring , the weather is very changeable - sometimes cold , sometimes warm . it ’ s usually windy with some rain . autumn is usually sunny and dry , but it ’ s gradually gets colder as winter arrives . what are the seasons like in you city ?  Speaker1:  well , i live in the southern hemisphere , so our summertime is your wintertime , and vice versa . we get some rain in every season , but most is in winter . in winter , it sometimes gets cold , but our winters are usually quite mild . summers are warm , but not hot . spring and autumn are both very short - sometimes just a few weeks each . the weather is very changeable then - just like spring in your city .  Speaker2:  do you usually go on a summer holiday ?  Speaker1:  no , i don ’ t . i go on a winter holiday instead . i go somewhere warm .

Speaker1: how do you think people get their personalities ?  Speaker2:  i think it ’ s mainly from the environment a person lives in .  Speaker1:  don ’ t you think people get their personalities from their parents ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  no , but parents control a lot of the environment that kids grow up in , so they certainly influence their kids ' personalities a lot .  Speaker1:  so why do you think many kids have personalities that are so different from their parents .  Speaker2:  maybe when they become teenagers , they want to be completely different to their parents .  Speaker1:  you might be right . i guess most parents want their kids to be like them , but kids today grow up in a different environment . you know , they know much more about the world from the internet , newspapers , and tv .  Speaker2:  do you think that teenagers get a lot of their bad behaviour from tv and movies ?  Speaker1:  maybe some of it . i think a lot of people blame tv and movies when the real problem is that the parents aren ’ t bringing their child up correctly .  Speaker2:  parents have a difficult job . they have to bring up their children and usually have to work too .  Speaker1:  yes , that ’ s true . your son is doing well at school , isn ’ t he ?

Speaker1:  ok , well , we ' re going to make a pan of lasagne , a salad , and some garlic bread . here ' s the recipe . do you want to get the ingredients we need out of the cupboard ?  Speaker2:  sure . we should probably pre - heat the oven right away , too .  Speaker1:  that ' s a good idea . can you set the oven to 200 degrees celsius ?  Speaker2:  that ' s a bit high for lasagne . i ' ll just set it at 180 degree and we can take it from there .  Speaker1:  fine . i ' ll just get out the casserole dish , the saucepan , the salad bowl , and the baking sheet .

Speaker1:  we ' ve heard so much about chinese film stars divorcing foreigners .

Speaker1:  now , she ’ ll be able to save up for that holiday in the united states .

Speaker1:  they did . he inherited the money form an uncle . i hope he doesn ’ t lose a lot of it in taxed to the government .  Speaker2:  dying can be very expensive nowadays ! what ’ s he going to do with it ?  Speaker1:  he said that he would probably invest most of it . he ’ s got a well - paid job , so he doesn ’ t need the money to cover day - to day expenses . he just wants some extra money available for when he retires .  Speaker2:  i had some good financial news yesterday too .  Speaker1:  really ? have you won a fortune in the lottery ?

Speaker1: you haven ' t spent much time with sophia lately . are you speaking to each other at the moment ?  Speaker2:  no , we ' re not . we ' ve been drifting apart for a while . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  but you two used to do everything together . i thought you really enjoyed each other ' s company .  Speaker2:  we did , but since she started her new job , all she does is hang out with her new friends from work .  Speaker1:  can ' t you hang out with them , too ?  Speaker2:  i could , but all they ever talk about is work , so i always end up feeling left out .  Speaker1:  maybe you should invite her over for dinner , so it ' s just the two of you .  Speaker2:  i tried that a few weeks ago and she ended bringing a pal from work with her ! she ' s so busy these days that it ' s just impossible to hang out with her .  Speaker1:  it can ' t be that bad . she was always a really good friend to you .  Speaker2:  you ' re right . she would never talk about me behind my back or hold a grudge . but she just doesn ' t seem very interested in our friendship anymore .  Speaker1:  she ' s probably just excited about her new job . you should give her some time . it would be a shame to lose such a good friend .  Speaker2:  i ' ve given her enough time . i ' m over it now . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  i still think you two should try to patch things up .

Speaker1: hey ! how was your first day of class ? i ’ m in level two and i ’ m loving my class this semester ! it ’ s great being in a class of international students ! _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  mine was ok , except that no one in my class speaks english . i guess it will force me to converse in chinese more in class so at least i should improve a lot this semester .  Speaker1:  that ’ s both fortunate and unfortunate . it ’ s the united nations in my class ! we have people from all over the world ! there are three germans , a pole , a scottish , two french , an american , a brazilian , a chilean , a new zealander , though he prefers to call himself a kiwi . who else do we have ? oh , we also have a moroccan , a togolese , a pakistani , and two indonesians !  Speaker2:  that ’ s quite the array of nationalities . everyone in my class is from asia , except me . there are a few south koreans , several japanese , malaysian , thai , singaporean , filipino , kazakhstan , and one russian .  Speaker1:  well , i think you ’ re pretty lucky actually . you ’ ll have the opportunity to learn so much about asian culture .  Speaker2:  i guess so , but i think it ’ s going to be hard to relate to my classmates , especially with the language barrier . i think i might change classes .  Speaker1:  don ’ t ! stay the course ! your spoken chinese will be eternally grateful . i bet you it will even surpass mine with all that practice .

Speaker1:  that ' s the return of the king , right ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  yeah . even though the customs were brilliant , i didn ' t think it was as good as the first two . what did you think ?  Speaker1:  i thought the special effects were amazing , but i got a bit confused . the plot was too complicated for me .  Speaker2:  did you read the books before you watched the movies ?  Speaker1:  no . did you ?  Speaker2:  yes , i ' ve read them many times . i think it ' s much easier to follow for people who were already familiar with all the characters .  Speaker1:  yes , trying to keep track of all the characters was quite confusing for me .  Speaker2:  i also think that it was much better in the theatre than at home .  Speaker1:  most movies are . another problem for me was the film was dubbed in german with english subtitles . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  that happens a lot in non - english speaking countries .  Speaker1:  i heard that the return of the king was nominated for 11 oscars .

Speaker2:  ben , we ’ re fifteen . what kind of job are you looking for ?

Speaker2:  your stereo is better than mine . do you mind if we use yours ?  Speaker1:  no , i don ' t mind . i just don ' t know where we can put the speakers in this tiny room .  Speaker2:  probably we can put one on that counter . and we can put one on the floor by the bed . over there .  Speaker1:  alright . that ' s a good plan . what about the desks ? we have two desks , one by the window and one by the door ? which one do you want ?  Speaker2:  well , the desk by the window is nicer , of course . don ' t you think ?  Speaker1:  yes , i agree .  Speaker2:  so since i got the bottom bunk , why don ' t you get the desk by the window ? that would be more fair .  Speaker1:  alright .  Speaker2:  i mean , we could flip a coin for it , but i would probably win again . i ' m incredibly lucky you know . especially with girls .  Speaker1:  is that right ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  yes , that ' s right . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  well , i hope you let me hang out with you then . maybe i can learn from you .

Speaker1:  addiction ? checking emails and text messages often can be called an addiction ? no way !  Speaker2:  yes , it is . do you consider a frequent check of your in - coming emails to be an integral part of your working day ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  absolutely . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  do you have your cell phone with you wherever you go and check text messages and phone calls from time to time ?

Speaker1: i heard you were teaching english over there . tell me about it . did you like it ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  oh , yes , it was very interesting . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  what were the schools like ?  Speaker2:  oh , i didn ' t actually teach in the schools . i taught after school . i taught in english institutes .  Speaker1:  but you taught children , yes ?  Speaker2:  yes . that ' s right . but children in taiwan are very different from children in america . at least as far as studying is concerned . many children in taiwan go to special institutes after school .  Speaker1:  they actually study after school ?  Speaker2:  that ' s right . after their school day is over , they go to a special institute to study math or english . they are very serious about learning over there .  Speaker1:  hmm . that sounds pretty oppressive for the kids . don ' t they ever relax ?  Speaker2:  of course they do . you know , eliza , before i went over there i thought the same thing . i thought that maybe kids in taiwan study too much . but now that i ' ve worked there , and taught them , i feel it is a good thing . their parents are very concerned about their education . more than american parents are . and that is good . american kids don ' t study enough .  Speaker1:  asian cultures value learning very much . i know that .  Speaker2:  so it was interesting for me to see parents very concerned about education . they would come to me after the class and ask how their son or daughter was doing . i don ' t think that ' s a bad thing . i think it ' s a good thing . in america , too many parents don ' t pay attention .  Speaker1:  but aren ' t the kids tired out ? i mean , they go to school all day , and then they go to school in the evening too .  Speaker2:  as an english teacher , i tried to make the lessons as fun as possible . i tried to have a good time with my classes . the students often enjoyed it . and if the students enjoyed it , they learned more . so it was a good experience .  Speaker1:  are the kids in taiwan very obedient ?  Speaker2:  that ' s a stereotype we americans have . we think that asian kids are very obedient and quiet . but it ' s not true . there are plenty of naughty kids too .  Speaker1:  hmm . i know you taught in costa rica also . which did you like better - - costa rica or taiwan ?

Speaker1: the dinner was really good . it knocked my socks off . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  that ' s very kind of you to say so . let ' s try some after - dinner wines .

Speaker2:  excellent choice . i love its smooth flavor .  Speaker1:  the port is exquisite . it must have spent years aging in barrels . am i right ?  Speaker2:  yes . you always have a good nose for wines .  Speaker1:  next time we are about to dinner we should try some canadian ice wine . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  oh , what ' s that ?  Speaker1:  it ' s made from naturally frozen grapes .  Speaker2:  why not ? it sounds great .  Speaker1:  oh , here ' s to your health .

Speaker1:  my wife will be going back to work soon .

( they come to the museum of the beijing opera art . ) _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  wow . look at this . so delicate and beautiful . did ancient chinese people really wear them ?  Speaker1:  not really . they are just opera costumes . do you like the embroidery ?  Speaker2:  i surely do . they must have had advanced machines in ancient china to do that .  Speaker1:  no , no , no . they are all handmade , girl . you know , the ancient chinese women were supposed to be good at needlework .  Speaker2:  unbelievable ! i could never do that .  Speaker1:  very few can . that ' s why these clothes only appear in the museum .  Speaker2:  listen ! some people are singing outside . is it the opera ?  Speaker1:  oh , yes . i heard there was an opera fans club . they are probably practicing now . wanna have a look ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  yes , let ' s do it .  Speaker1:  follow me . make sure not to interrupt them .

Speaker2:  well , we drove through the valley on our way there in the morning . it was a magnificent sight !  Speaker1:  did you stop at the fall for some pictures ?  Speaker2:  sure , we wouldn ' t miss that for anything . after that , we took a short cut to the park . there was very little traffic , so we got there in less than an hour . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  you were lucky then . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  yeah , we spent the whole morning under the tall trees . we had our picnic there , too . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  what did you do after that ?  Speaker2:  we went for a swim in the sea . that was the biggest part of the day . just look at my nice tan !  Speaker1:  so you must have had a busy and enjoyable day yesterday .

Speaker1: hey lydia , what are you reading ?  Speaker2:  i ’ m looking at my horoscope for this month ! my outlook is very positive . it says that i should take a vacation to someplace exotic , and that i will have a passionate summer fling !  Speaker1:  what are you talking about ? let me see that . . . what are horoscopes ?  Speaker2:  it ’ s a prediction of your month , based on your zodiac sign . you have a different sign for the month and date you were born in . i was born on april 15th , so i ’ m an aries . when were you born ?  Speaker1:  january 5th . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  let ’ s see . . . you ’ re a capricorn . it says that you will be feeling stress at work , but you could see new , exciting developments in your love life . looks like we ’ ll both have interesting summers !  Speaker1:  that ’ s bogus . i don ’ t feel any stress at work , and my love life is practically nonexistent . this zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense .  Speaker2:  no , it ’ s not , your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality . see ? it says that an aries is energetic and loves to socialize .  Speaker1:  well , you certainly match those criteria , but they ’ re so broad they could apply to anyone . what does it say about me ?
 | 
Speaker1: oh , my god . how can you stand living in such a messy dorm ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  our place is spotlessly clean , compared with others .

Speaker1:  i think we need to restart the dormitory sanitation inspection system .

Speaker1:  what did your boss say ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  he told me that if i showed up late one more time , he ' d fire me . he ' s so mean !

Speaker1:  is your boss chinese ?  Speaker2:  no , he ' s from australia . before i met him , i thought australians were supposed to be relaxed and easy - going . i had no idea he ' d be so fussy about things . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  what are you going to do ?  Speaker2:  i think i ' m going to look for another job . i need to find a boss that is a bit more sensitive and optimistic than my current boss .

Speaker1:  oh , i know . sometimes i have the same feeling with you . but you ' d better not be so emotional . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  can you stay and accompany me for a while ?  Speaker1:  sure , no problem . you can call me any time you are alone from now on .

Speaker1:  i don ' t think we need too much in the way of soft drinks , two super bottles of cola should cover everyone . what about wine ?  Speaker2:  just buy a cask of wine . have you bought ice yet ?  Speaker1:  no , once i fill the tub with beer , i ' ll get the ice . the beer will be cool if you put the tub under the ice . the cooler , the better .

Speaker1: can you be serious for a moment , we ' ve been dating for 6 months now , i really like you . i ' d like to take a relationship to the next level .  Speaker2:  so what are you trying to say to me ?  Speaker1:  it feels like you are not dedicate to our relationship . it seems like you treat it as a just casual dating .  Speaker2:  how should i say it ?  Speaker1:  i don ' t want to be like this . i think we should get step further .  Speaker2:  it has only been 6 months , our relationship hasn ' t had a chance to maturate . we are still have some hurdle we have to jump over .  Speaker1:  like what ?  Speaker2:  last week i saw brain kissing you on the cheek .

Speaker1: how did you get around over there ? did you rent cars ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  no , that would be too expensive . we used the train system . we bought a special pass called a enrail pass . it lets people use the train wherever they want , as often as they want .  Speaker1:  i ' ve heard about enrail passes . so those europeans really depend on trains a lot .  Speaker2:  yes , they do . i wish we americans had a better train system .  Speaker1:  i know . our train system is lousy . and besides , americans love their cars too much .  Speaker2:  i agree . and probably the automobile companies are too powerful . they never allowed the government to develop trains .  Speaker1:  it ' s too bad for the environment . so much pollution from cars .  Speaker2:  americans love cars for different reasons , i think . one reason is that we are very individualistic . and cars are a very individual way of getting around . americans like the freedom of driving around by themselves . they don ' t want to ride in a train or bus with a group of people .  Speaker1:  yes , i agree . i think it is a cultural characteristic . it would be very hard to get us americans to change this . but you know what ? probably , in the future , americans will have to change .  Speaker2:  why do you say " have to " ?  Speaker1:  because the earth ' s environment can ' t tolerate cars forever . i think cars are already causing global warming . when the problem gets more serious , world governments will have to start limiting car use .  Speaker2:  maybe you ' re right . they will have to develop alternative transportation . but it will be hard in america . too many people are used to cars . even in our movies cars are very important .  Speaker1:  wow ! i didn ' t notice the time . it ' s almost noon . i have to get home . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  do you want me to give you a ride ?  Speaker1:  no , no problem . i have my car in the parking ramp around the corner .

Speaker2:  yes , his marriage to katie is actually quite scandalous .  Speaker1:  i still think that they only got married to get more publicity for their movies and themselves .  Speaker2:  people in show biz can have such an easy life ; i don ' t know why they have to make it so complicated .  Speaker1:  i would never want to be a celebrity because the paparazzi would also be after you .

Speaker2:  so he had the boxes wrapped in plastic .  Speaker1:  yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products . look , it even had a bar - code price sticker on it ! it looked brand new .  Speaker2:  but why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ?  Speaker1:  he said he had to get rid of them . they were stolen .  Speaker2:  aha ! now i understand . you were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk . so , what i think is , you deserve to get cheated !  Speaker1:  c ' mon , don ' t blame me ! i thought it was a new camera . we could use it . we were even thinking about buying a camera . i don ' t understand how he could have such a perfect - looking box .

Speaker2:  indeed , no man can be perfect . he is just so - so in crashing the boards . usually he plays shooting guard . rebounding might not be his strong suit .

Speaker2:  jacob , you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling . i don ’ t . i have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings . every day , i wake up and head straight for the shower . every second day , i wash my hair . if it ’ s a hair - washing day , i frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily . then i usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too . because my hair is so long , i seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes . afterwards , i often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while i wait for it to brew . i take a long time to get dressed in the morning . every now and then i remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually i do it in the morning . in all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi - dry so then i have to style my hair . from time to time i ’ ll put my hair up , butoften times i bloody it straight . and then , because of the texture of my hair , i regularly have to flat - iron it to keep it from frizzing . that ’ s another twenty minutes or so . after that , i have my daily makeup routine .  Speaker1:  true , i hardly ever see you without your hair done and your makeup on , even when you show up to class in sweatpants . tell me , how long does it take you to choose that outfit in the morning ?

Speaker1: did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time ?  Speaker2:  what ? why do we have to do that ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  well , at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon . this is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth . in any case , to take better advantage of the daylight available , we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour .  Speaker2:  i see . that ’ s convenient ! i never understood things like this , such as gmt . i never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock !  Speaker1:  that just stands for greenwich mean time . here in california , we are in pacific standard time , that is eight time zones west of greenwich . remember when we were in beijing ? well , then we were in china standard time , and that ’ s eight time zones east of greenwich !

Speaker1:  your tradition of throwing rice as they got into their car was interesting , but it didn ' t look like real rice to me .  Speaker2:  it wasn ' t . it was birdseed . we don ' t throw rice anymore because someone discovered that birds come along and eat the rice and have trouble digesting it .  Speaker1:  oh , i didn ' t think of that . well , this reception reminds me of weddingparties back in china . plenty of food and drink , music and dancing , and interesting traditions .  Speaker2:  wait until you see what happens next ! the bride is getting ready to throw her bouquet . let ' s go over and watch .

Speaker1:  so if i ' m looking for a look called a history of western society , i ' d just look under ' a ' .  Speaker2:  no . you ' d look under ' w ' . the articles ' a ' and ' the ' don ' t count in our alphabetization , and cards are generally omitted for extremely common words and phrases such as ' history of ' , ' introduction to ' , ' story of ' and so forth . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  what if i don ' t know the title of the book ?  Speaker2:  well , you can look under the author ' s name .  Speaker1:  could you give me an example ?

Speaker1: would you like to go skiing with me ? i heard the new ski area is great . they have safe tracks , especially for the beginners and provide free training . i think it suits you best . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  sounds not bad ! you know , the only thing i worried about is the safety . i ’ m not an active exerciser and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport .  Speaker1:  then you can go to the three - day - long training camp first . there ’ re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise .

Speaker1: i watched a very interesting documentary about plants yesterday evening . it was called unusual plants and looked at several species of plants from around the world which have unusual features .  Speaker2:  really ? tell me about some of the plants they showed .  Speaker1:  well . there was one type of plant that catches insects and eats them .  Speaker2:  is that type of plant found in this country ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  no , it isn ’ t . it ’ s a pity , because i ’ d like to see it in action .  Speaker2:  so would i . what other unusual plants did they show ?  Speaker1:  they showed flowers that only provide their nectar to one type of butterfly or bee . the insect has to be the exact size to get the nectar . other insects cannot get it . of course , when the insect molle  Speaker2:  that ’ s very specialized . so , the insects and the flowers rely on each other . if one became extinct , the other would too .  Speaker1:  that ’ s right . that ’ s one reason why it ’ s so important to protect every species .  Speaker2:  i see . the plants that fascinate me most are cacti . i find it amazing that they can survive in such dry desert conditions .  Speaker1:  according to the documentary , they have an incredible ability to find water supplies , however small , and then store them without losing much through evaporation .

Speaker1: what kinds of tv programmes do you enjoy watching ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  i like current affairs programmes and documentaries , especially wildlife ones . how about you ?  Speaker1:  i like those kinds of programmes too . they ’ re very informative . i think that many people underrate the education value of tv .  Speaker2:  i agree . people often criticize tv for showing too much sex and violence .  Speaker1:  yeah . and that ’ s so funny because most people prefer watching sex and violence to watching something more educational !  Speaker2:  right . you can ’ t blame the tv stations for showing popular kinds of programmes . they need to make money from advertisements shown during and between programmes .  Speaker1:  in my country , there ’ s a time limit on the advertisements that can be shown . i think it ’ s about six minutes per hour .  Speaker2:  that ’ s great idea . but don ’ t the tv station lose a lot of money because of that ?  Speaker1:  no . they don ’ t . they simply charge higher prices at peak times . is there no limit on the amount of advertisements that can be shown on tv in your country ?  Speaker2:  not as far as i know . we have so many advertisements . the interruptions are unbearable sometimes ! that ’ s one reason that many people prefer satellite or cable tv , where you pay a fixed amount each mo  Speaker1:  some people have satellite and cable tv in my country , but people don ’ t seem to keen to pay for their tv programmes . besides , the terrestrial channels offer a good range of programmes .

Speaker1: how do i apply to an american university ?  Speaker2:  you should go to the library to find some information about american universities , and write to the admission office . then the admission office will send you application forms and other related materials . from experience , many applicants write to several universities instead of just one .  Speaker1:  i was told that it took a lot of time and effort to apply .  Speaker2:  that is true . i ’ ll list for you the requirements of almost all the universities . first of all , you need official transcripts of your undergraduate work , three letters of recommendation from your professors who know your competence , and the official toefl ( test of english as a foreign language ) score ( it ’ s usually 550 ) . then you need a financial guarantee , and an application fee of 25 dollars .

Speaker1: so , monica , what do you feel like doing this afternoon ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  actually , i had a perfect plan for this afternoon , but it is totally ruined by the sand storm . i woke up this morning and found it was sunny . so i called lucy and asked her to go shopping with me . we were going to look for a new purse . now it turned out to be like this . neither of us wants to go to outside anymore .  Speaker1:  that ’ s too bad . i hate sand storms too . it can be worse than any kind of bad weather .  Speaker2:  what ’ s wrong with climate ? anyway , i think the sand storm happens more frequently these days than the years before . can ’ t people do something to stop it ?  Speaker1:  it is not an easy job . the government is working on it . lots of trees have been planted in the north of the capital . also , methods of generating rain are being used by the government to fight against the drought . but of course , it will not work overnight . so , have you come out with a new plan for today ?

Speaker1:  i have a running machine at home . i used to use it , but i already got sick of it .  Speaker2:  exercising at home is hard . the environment is not suited for exercising .

Speaker1:  yeah , you ’ re right . when it comes down to it , i can be pretty tacky .

Speaker1: bobby ! come here , look what i got you !  Speaker2:  what is that ?  Speaker1:  a chess board ! daddy is going to teach you how to play ! _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  cool ! _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  ok , each player gets 16 pieces . you can be the white ones and i ’ ll play with the black pieces . now in the front , you set up the pawns . those are the least valuable pieces and can only move one space forward . when you are about to capture another piece , it can move one space diagonally .  Speaker2:  what about all these other pieces ?  Speaker1:  see this one that looks like a tower ? it ’ s called the rook . the one with the tall hat is called the bishop . see this little horsey ? this is called the knight , it ’ s a very important piece so it ’ s best to not let your opponent capture it .  Speaker2:  and these two ? they are husband and wife ?  Speaker1:  that ’ s right ! that ’ s the queen and that ’ s the king . if the other player captures your king , he will say check mate and the game is over ! doesn ’ t this sound fun ?

Speaker1:  yes , i am . i am from taiwan . i came here to study political science . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  how do you like it ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  i like it so far . but my english still needs work .  Speaker2:  i want to study mandarin and international relations .  Speaker1:  does the chinese department here teach regular characters or simplified characters ?  Speaker2:  they teach regular characters .  Speaker1:  i see . i ' m from taiwan , so i know regular characters better than simplified .  Speaker2:  you just said your english needs work , yes ?  Speaker1:  yes , that ' s true . especially my writing . i think my papers aren ' t good enough . i make too many grammatical mistakes .  Speaker2:  well , i am very serious about learning chinese . but for me the hard part now is pronunciation . you have the four tones in chinese . it is very hard . maybe , if you have time , maybe we could do a language exchange . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  you mean you and i ?  Speaker2:  yes , why not ? i mean , if you come to this cafe often , maybe we could meet here and practice chinese and english .  Speaker1:  that sounds like a good idea . how often would you like to do it ?  Speaker2:  let ' s see . . . my schedule right now is quite busy . but i think i could spend 90 minutes a week in language exchange .  Speaker1:  how would we manage it though ? how would we spend the 90 minutes ?  Speaker2:  first , we could spend 45 minutes working on your english writing . if you want , i could help you edit your papers . or we could do english conversation . whatever you want . and then the next 45 minutes you would help me with my chinese .  Speaker1:  would i help you with writing ?  Speaker2:  no . for me right now , the important thing is spoken chinese . i need practice . so you could tutor me in speaking . we could use my textbook , and you could ask me questions . then you could correct my mistakes .  Speaker1:  i think it sounds like a good system . but when is it convenient to meet ?  Speaker2:  well , today is monday . actually , for me monday at this time would be the best . i am free from now until 11  Speaker1:  me too . in fact , i ' m free until 1  Speaker2:  so if you want to meet at 10  Speaker1:  it sounds good . i will bring the papers i ' m working on .

Speaker2:  well , you are a very hard - worker .  Speaker1:  i try very hard . the problem is , my salary just isn ' t enough to live on . now that i have a wife and a child to support , we hardly have enough money for food and rent .  Speaker2:  there are trying times for everyone . what do you propose ?  Speaker1:  i could really use a 5 % rise . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  that ' s quite a bit . if i give you a raise , i ' m going to have to give everyone a raise .  Speaker1:  listen , if you give me a raise , i ' ll take on extra responsibilities .  Speaker2:  that sounds reasonable . how about this , from now on , you can be responsible for scheduling . that means that if you can ' t find someone to cover a shift , then you ' ll have to do it .  Speaker1:  that ' s fine . do i get over - time for any extra hours that i work ?  Speaker2:  of course . it ' s be against the law if we didn ' t .  Speaker1:  that sounds good to me . i really appreciate it .

Speaker2:  yeah ! i am here with my friend and he thinks it may be the spark plug or the starter motor .  Speaker1:  those are possible problems , but tell me , when you turn the key , do you hear the starter motor crank ?  Speaker2:  yeah , it sounds like it usually does when i start the car , but nothing else happens . the engine won ’ t start . should i maybe press the accelerator ?  Speaker1:  no . if you step on the accelerator pedal you can flood the carburetor and your car will never start . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  so what do you think it is ?  Speaker1:  i know this may seem like a silly question , but does your car have gasoline ?

Speaker1: do you have a copy of today ’ s newspaper ? i want to check the results from the world athletics championship . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  yes , i ‘ m just reading them myself . it ’ s been a great competition . we got gold medals in three events .  Speaker1:  yes , we won the men ’ s 110 metres hurdles . i watched that on tv . what other events did we win ?  Speaker2:  we won the men ’ s high jump and the women ’ s 1500 meters .  Speaker1:  that ’ s great . those athletes must train for years to get into peak physical condition . they must be terribly disappointed if they don ’ t win .  Speaker2:  the woman who won the 1500 meters also broke the world record by 2 seconds .  Speaker1:  that ’ s amazing ! were any other records broken ?  Speaker2:  a russian man broke the discus record by a centimeters . out best athlete broke his personal best in the long jump , but it only got him third place .  Speaker1:  did you see the final of the men ’ s 100 metres ? it was very exciting . one competitor made two false starts .

Speaker2:  good question . i have to think about it . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  my husband is betting on france .  Speaker2:  france ? is he crazy ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  what do you mean ?
 | 
Speaker1: is there something wrong ? you look so sad . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  my house was robbed last night and the thieves stole all my furniture . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  no wonder you look so upset . have you called the police ?

Speaker1:  i ' d like to get a ba , but i don ' t know where i should go .  Speaker2:  have you applied anywhere yet ?  Speaker1:  yes , i ' ve applied to four universities and have been accepted into all of them .  Speaker2:  congratulations ! which one is the cheapest ?  Speaker1:  the tuition is the same for all of them .  Speaker2:  which one has the most interesting course ?  Speaker1:  i think the course at leeds university is interesting , but i think the one at manchester university would be more practical .  Speaker2:  where would you like to be located ?  Speaker1:  i ' d really like to be in london , but it ' s the most expensive city in england to live in , so i don ' t know if i can afford to live there .  Speaker2:  have you applied for grants or financial aid of some sort ?  Speaker1:  not yet .  Speaker2:  i think you should do that soon . it will help you make a decision about the school you go to . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  that ' s a good idea .

 | 
Speaker1: there are so many environment problems in the world today . do you think we can really solve them all or will destroy the world ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  i hope that world leaders can get together and agree on a plan of action , but i doubt it ’ ll happen before it ’ s too late .  Speaker1:  we need to solve the problem of air pollution before we destroy the atmosphere . there ’ s lots of clean , modern technology , but companies in developed countries say it ’ s expensive . developing countries  Speaker2:  everyone is looking at the issue in the short term , rather than the long term . it ’ s the same with the destruction of the rainforests . countries and companies just want the wood . they ’ re not thinking a  Speaker1:  in other parts of the world , especially in africa , there is a problem with desertification . climate change and over - farming are causing farmland to turn into desert . in means that people cannot grow e  Speaker2:  it also means that people sometimes fight over the farmland that remains . damaging the environment actually leads to conflict between people .  Speaker1:  have you ever thought about joining an organization committed to protecting the environment ? you could get involved with projects to improve the environment .
 | 
Speaker1: going to the cafeteria ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  no , i am not eating there anymore . i have ordered my favorite food in the restaurant around the corner . the food served in the cafeteria is not my type . i am a total meat lover . but the cafeteria is doing its best to force me to be a vegetarian . they have been serving the chinese cabbage and white gorse for three days . haven ’ t you noticed that ?  Speaker1:  that ’ s fine with me . i don ’ t hate vegetables and i don ’ t eat much during lunch .

Speaker1:  oh yeah , i saw the tea house the other day . i think i might go and have a look sometime . it ' s a nice neighborhood here .  Speaker2:  you are right about that . it ' s quiet and very convenient . you can get to the bus and the subway stations within ten minutes ' walk . there ' s a grocery store , a book store , a gym , and many restaurants  Speaker1:  there ' s a gym nearby ? that ' s exciting ! i really want to start to go to gym as soon as possible . i ' ve been lazy this summer holiday and have put on some weight .
 | 
Speaker1: i am totally fed up with my boss . he has crossed the line one too many times with his sexist comments . this time i am really going to report him for sexual harassment . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  what happened ? did your boss say something to offend you at work ?  Speaker1:  he constantly lets inappropriate things slip out , referring to the women employees as girls or calling us sweetheart or darling . i doubt any of my male colleagues would stand for such treatment .  Speaker2:  don ’ t you think you are overreacting a little ? calling you by nicknames shouldn ’ t be so bad . . .  Speaker1:  you ’ re missing the point . it ’ s about respect . he treats us with such a patronizing attitude , as if we are not equal or not as serious as our male co - workers . it ’ s his attitude that needs to be changed , not just his words .
 | 
Speaker1: is your lady beautiful ? since i came here from the country , i ' ve not seen her close . tell me , is she beautiful ?  Speaker2:  thomas , if i could write with the beauty in her eyes , i was born to look in them and know myself .  Speaker1:  and , her lips ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  her lips ? the early morning rose would wither on the branch if it could feel envy .  Speaker1:  and her voice like a lark ' s song ?  Speaker2:  deeper , softer , none of your twittering larks . i would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupted her song . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  oh , she sings too ?
 | 
Speaker1: would you like to have dinner with me tonight ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  sorry , i have to work overtime . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  you are really career minded .
 | 
Speaker1: it ' s going to strike 12 o ' clock . let ' s get the firecrackers ready , rose .  Speaker2:  aren ' t firecrackers forbidden in the city ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  well yes , but they are not allowed only in downtown areas . it ' s ok here . it would be difficult to ban customs that have thousands of years of tradition . the habit does bring kids joy and excitement so long as precautions are taken . let ' s go out and set off firecrackers out there .  Speaker2:  fantastic ! the whole city is echoing with crackling sounds !  Speaker1:  what other activities will you have tomorrow ?  Speaker2:  quite a lot . the celebration of the new year has just started . the first day we southerners have sweet rice cakes for breakfast , and people in the north have jiaozi . afterward , we will make new year calls on family relatives , husband ' s side on the first day and wife ' s side on the second .  Speaker1:  do you bring some gifts along ?  Speaker2:  that ' s for sure . fruit , cream cakes , medical tonics are often for parents and aged relatives , and cash enclosed in a red envelope for the kids . all this , of course , should be well prepared beforehand .  Speaker1:  is it the same practice for all families ?  Speaker2:  not all the same nowadays i must say . many families , especially those of newly married couples , choose to make an overseas trip to escape the routines . rose and i had a tour to singapore , malaysia , thailand and hong kong last year . we stayed there for two weeks until the last day of the holiday .  Speaker1:  i really appreciate the way you chinese people exchange feelings . the holiday ' s long enough for you to relax .
 | 
Speaker1: you seem to be very hesitant about doing things .  Speaker2:  i don ' t know why i cannot take a step forward .  Speaker1:  you are meeting trouble halfway , i guess .
 | 
Speaker1: how ' s your new apartment ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  i thought it was in a quiet neighborhood , but it isn ' t . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  what ' s wrong ?  Speaker2:  one of my neighbors has a dog .  Speaker1:  does it make a lot of noise ?
 | 
Speaker1: dad , i ’ d like to borrow some money .  Speaker2:  sure , johnny , how much do you need ? five bucks ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  come on , dad , i need thirty thousand . i wanna get into the market . you know , i ’ m tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn , the inevitable recession , people stuffing their money in their mattresses . i look at this as an opportunity . this is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg .  Speaker2:  i don ’ t know about that ; with all the uncertainty in the markets right now , it would be a very unwise decision to invest . i don ’ t know if you ’ re aware son , but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently . there have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months , and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy . there ’ s just too much instability . i wouldn ’ t feel comfortable investing in this climate .  Speaker1:  but look at it this way , every challenge is an opportunity . and anyway , i ’ m not talking about investing in the domestic market . there are emerging markets that promise great returns . look at china , for example , they have 1 . 4 billion people , half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class . here alone the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity .

Speaker1: what do you think of smoking ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  it ’ s harmful not only for yourself but for others . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  what in your opinion can be done to stop smoking ?

 | 
Speaker1: do you like playing games ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  i like playing computer games , but i ' m not really into board games .  Speaker1:  how about individual games like the rubik ' s cube or solitaire ?  Speaker2:  the rubik ' s cube is so difficult to solve that i think it should be banned !  Speaker1:  if i taught you how to do it , i ' m sure you could solve it .  Speaker2:  how did you figure out how to slove the rubik ' s cube ?  Speaker1:  i didn ' t really have to figure it out . i just followed the instructions !  Speaker2:  i had no idea there were a set of instructions . i thought everyone who could solve it were all geniuses !  Speaker1:  hints are really important when you ' re solving puzzles . if you give me some hints about playing that ps2 game , i ’ ll show you how to solve the rubik ' s cube .  Speaker2:  it ' s a deal .  Speaker1:  do you remember , years ago , when everybody at the new year ' s party had yo - yos ?  Speaker2:  yeah . that was a strange party . can you still do any of those yo - yo tricks ?  Speaker1:  i don ' t know . i haven ' t tried yo - yo since that party !  Speaker2:  i could never figure out how to use my yo - yo . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  if you don ' t start when you ' re young , it ' s hard to get the hang of it .

Speaker1: a beautiful center !
 | 
Speaker1: mary , there ' s one more thing that you must do for me before you leave .  Speaker2:  what is it ?  Speaker1:  you have to take the math and english evaluation tests .  Speaker2:  why ?  Speaker1:  because you ' re from a foreign country . the school needs to find out how good you are at both basic skills .  Speaker2:  it ' s so that i can be put into the right math and english classes , right ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  you are a smart girl !

Speaker1: i have a bone to pick with you .  Speaker2:  okay . let ’ s clear the air . what are you getting at ?  Speaker1:  you always have a chip on your shoulder .
 | 
Speaker1: ok , nick . here ' s the question , what movie and its sequel both won an oscar for best picture ?  Speaker2:  the godfather and the godfather ii , of course . they were both directed by francis ford coppola . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  whew ! i ' m impressed ! you really know your stuff !
 | 
Speaker1: it is obvious that their government is nursing the hope of having all other countries over a barrel and bring them completely under their control . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  it ’ s a typical of them to do so . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  what can we do ?
 |

 | 
Speaker1: how do you get along with your co - workers ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  i get along pretty well with most of them . it seems there are always a few rotten apples in the bunch , though , like margaret . i don ' t know why management hasn ' t fired her yet . she ' s a terrible gossip .  Speaker1:  do you think management should fire someone just because they gossip ?  Speaker2:  it ' s not only that she gossips , but she also tries to start problems among other employees by spreading rumors and telling lies about her co - workers . she ' s not trustworthy , and in my opinion , i think she ' s nuts .  Speaker1:  so how do you develop good relationships in the office ?
 | 
Speaker1: thanks a lot for having us . we had a good time . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  i ' m glad you came . you ' re welcome anytime . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  thanks . by the way , tell your wife she throws a great party .
 | 
Speaker1: so how did you meet bill ?  Speaker2:  i met him through a computer bulletin board .  Speaker1:  oh , really ? which bulletin board ?  Speaker2:  it was one i used down at the local coffee house called the san francisco net . it ' s been around since around 1991 .  Speaker1:  i ' ve heard about that , but i ' ve never tried it . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  you ought to . one dollar buys you 15 minutes of computer time . a chat session links you with cappuccino sippers in other cafes and also to home computers on the network .  Speaker1:  i have no desire to talk on a network with a bunch of strangers .  Speaker2:  that ' s the whole point . all your inhibitions disappear because you can ’ t see the other person . this network allows you to talk to people whom you normally wouldn ’ t talk to .  Speaker1:  i just want a private conversation with one other person .  Speaker2:  you can do that . a private session lets two people talk alone . this techno - chat program lets you talk about anything with everybody , without prejudice because you can ’ t see them .  Speaker1:  well , maybe i ' ll tag along and watch how you talk .  Speaker2:  that ' s fine with me , but we ' ll have to get there early . because after 8 pm , there is always a long line . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  it ’ s that popular ?
 | 
Speaker1: have you seen that house ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  yes , it looks interesting .  Speaker1:  you ' re right . i love it very much . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  it must be old .  Speaker1:  at least more than 100 years old .  Speaker2:  let ' s enter it !  Speaker1:  i can ' t open the door .  Speaker2:  it must be locked .  Speaker1:  let me ask the old woman in that reception office .  Speaker2:  she can ' t answer you .  Speaker1:  she must be deaf .
 | 
Speaker1: have a nice weekend ! _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  thanks . you too ! _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  do you have any plans ?
 | 
Speaker1: what did you major in ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  i major in chemistry . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  what is your specialty ?
 | 
Speaker1: the national day is coming . what are you going to do during the holiday ?  Speaker2:  i have no idea .  Speaker1:  why don ' t you go sightseeing ?
 | 
Speaker1: good morning , john . have you finished reading the novel by dickens borrowed from the library ?  Speaker2:  no . i caught a cold two days ago . i only finish reading half of it .  Speaker1:  i ' m sorry to hear that . how are you feeling now ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  i ' m feeling better today . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  how many days do you plan to finish reading it ?

 | 
Speaker1: ouch !
 | 
Speaker1: hi , lilly , it ’ s so nice to see you again . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  hum , me too . this winter holiday was especially long . what have you done ?  Speaker1:  nothing special . i had a get - together with some schoolmates at the high school , visited the internet and read a couple of books which i had been longing for . how about yours ?
 | 
Speaker1: you know , i really don ’ t think americans are very romantic .  Speaker2:  where did you get that idea ?  Speaker1:  that ’ s the impression i get from the movies , and from looking around . men and women seem very business - like in their relations with each other .  Speaker2:  well , i ’ m still not sure what you ’ re asking me .  Speaker1:  is it true or isn ’ t it ?  Speaker2:  do you want to know something about the american character ?  Speaker1:  i just think you ’ re trying to change the subject . but go ahead .  Speaker2:  no , this will help answer your question . in american society boys and girls are raised together . they ’ re not segregated in their activities ! boys and girls go out together from an early age . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  ok , go on . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  after being raised together , men and women can be business - like in each other ’ s company . it really doesn ’ t have anything to do with the way a man and woman behave toward each other when they are in love . does that answer your question ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  not exactly , but i see your point .
 | 
Speaker1: it ' s a lovely day , isn ' t it ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  yes , the weather sure is nice today . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  i love it when the weather is like this . why don ' t we sit down outside and have our lunch ?  Speaker2:  that sounds like a good idea . the sky is clear , the sun is shining and there ' s a nice cool breeze , so it is not too hot .  Speaker1:  i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado . but i must admit , this sure is a nice spring day .  Speaker2:  hey , this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .  Speaker1:  okay . hey , is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
 | 
Speaker1: are you going to the cafeteria downstairs ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  yes . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  could you please get me a takeaway ? i have some urgent work to finish . so i don ’ t have enough time to go out for lunch .
 |

 | 
Speaker1: did you ever take history 231 ?  Speaker2:  yeah . last semester .  Speaker1:  who was the professor ?  Speaker2:  it was professor johnson .  Speaker1:  i have him this semester . what do you think about him ?  Speaker2:  he ' s a terrible instructor and demands a lot , but fortunately , he ' s an easy grader .  Speaker1:  what did you end up getting ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  i got an a - . sounds good , but none of my test scores were that high , so i don ' t know how i got a decent grade .  Speaker1:  that ' s probably because he grades on a curve .  Speaker2:  are you enjoying the class so far ?  Speaker1:  i hate it and i was about to withdrawal . but after hearing your experience , i think i will tough it out .
 | 
Speaker1: so how long have you known mary ?  Speaker2:  only four days . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  only four days ! that ' s so short , and you seem so crazy about her .
 | 
Speaker1: hi , happy new year !  Speaker2:  hey , the same to you !  Speaker1:  time flies ! one year has already been a history !  Speaker2:  definitely , it ' s time to say bye - bye to the last year and to say hello to the new year !  Speaker1:  yeah . have you made any good resolutions for this new year ?  Speaker2:  some resolutions ? that ' s a wonderful idea , but i have no idea yet . how about you ?  Speaker1:  i want to be healthier this year , so i think i should take more exercise . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  that will be a good one ! anything else ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  maybe i should make a plan about learning my biochemistry , which is a mess !
 | 
Speaker1: it ' s weekend again , i ' m glad i can arrange for my personal matters .  Speaker2:  what do you mean by that ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  oh , that means i can do whatever i like without few interruptions . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  you ' ve been always active and versatile . it seems that you are interested in everything .  Speaker1:  oh , really ? i just have lots of hobbies in my spare time ; such as going to the concert , painting , handwriting , reading novels and reading fashion magazines . what about yours ?  Speaker2:  i have fewer hobbies than yours . that ' s why i find campus life a bit dull and uninteresting .  Speaker1:  oh , you can ' t think like that . we young people should try our best to learn new things and accept new ideas . you like taking photos and going to photography shows , why not practise the technique and catch something unforgeable ?  Speaker2:  that ' s a good suggestion . it ' s fine today . maybe i can take photos on the scenery of the lake at sunset . it must be fantastic .  Speaker1:  i quite agree with you . with our hobbies , our life can be more colorful and exciting .
 | 
Speaker1: hey , jane . . . are you familiar with our company ' s insurance policies ?  Speaker2:  umm . . . i think so . what ' s up ?  Speaker1:  i ' ve never really paid attention to the fine print of our insurance policies . . . but it looks like i ' m going to need to make a claim .  Speaker2:  really ? are you ok ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  i have a slipped disc in my lower back and the doctor says surgery is probably the best option . does our worker insurance cover this kind of thing ?  Speaker2:  if the injury is workplace related i ' m sure it ' s completely covered .  Speaker1:  hummum . . . i think i ' ll have to talk to the doctor again about that . anyway . . . now that i ' m going to have to make some claims , i think i ' d better try and understand how the system works . would you mind breaking it down for me ?  Speaker2:  sure . basically we have two insurance policies for employees . . . workman ' s compensation and medical insurance . the company pays the premiums for workman ' s compensation , and for a significant part of the medical coverage , but you pay part of that premium , too .  Speaker1:  that ' s the charge for insurance i see on my pay slip each month , right ?  Speaker2:  yep . every country in the world has a different system , but here we buy insurance from a private provider .  Speaker1:  so workman ' s compensation is if i slip and break my arm while working in the office or on the job , right ?
 | 
Speaker1: i decided to go for this kind of life . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  try to keep cool . it ' s not an easy take .  Speaker1:  i know . i always hope for the best and prepare for the worst .

Speaker2:  the giants are up by three points because of the field goal they kicked , but the redskins have the ball and there pretty close to the end zone .  Speaker1:  wow ! what a hit !  Speaker2:  yeah , he tackled him so hard his helmet came off .  Speaker1:  is he ok ?  Speaker2:  it looks like it , he ’ s getting up .  Speaker1:  i guess he hit him too hard ; the referee just called a penalty on the home team .  Speaker2:  the giants ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  yeah .  Speaker2:  well , here we go again . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  what happened ? why did everyone get so quiet ?
 |

Speaker2:  no , i never do that .  Speaker1:  why not ?  Speaker2:  i don ' t want to mark my table , of course .  Speaker1:  well , will you please put them down ?  Speaker2:  i ' m sorry . i thought you wouldn ' t come back so early .  Speaker1:  i forgot something on the table .

Speaker1:  i have told him how to do it several times , but he ' s never listened to me .  Speaker2:  maybe you should communicate with him like a friend and not a boss .  Speaker1:  oh , i always have difficulty in getting along with the staff .  Speaker2:  just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do , make sure you don ' t lose your temper .  Speaker1:  i think that ' s a bad idea . i ' d hate anyone here to think of me as a friend . how would they ever respect me as they can do whatever they want ?

 | 
Speaker1: i ’ ve always wondered , what ’ s the difference between english for chinese students and english for native students ?  Speaker2:  i don ’ t know . what do you think ?  Speaker1:  i think a chinese student concentrates on written english , and uses it as a basis for communicating . from start to finish he ’ s learning vocabulary and fundamentals of grammar . this is a very difficult way to learn .  Speaker2:  what do natives get ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  they get higher level english , which is more formal than everyday spoken english . they also deal with matters of style and creativity .  Speaker2:  do you mean that a native doesn ’ t make any mistakes in grammar ?  Speaker1:  absolutely not ! native speakers make a lot of grammar mistakes , especially if they come from a home where nonstandard english is spoken .

Speaker1:  do you want to listen to your messages first ?  Speaker2:  no , it ' s ok . check your email first ; i ' ll check my unbox later .  Speaker1:  i ' m surprised you don ' t use more of the features on your phone .  Speaker2:  i ' m surprised you know so much about it . where ' s your phone ?  Speaker1:  it quit working last week and i haven ' t had a chance to buy a new one yet .  Speaker2:  how have you been living without a cell phone for a week ? hasn ' t it been driving you carry being without a phone ?

Speaker1:  you ’ d better give up smoking . it ’ s bad for your health .  Speaker2:  you ’ re right . but you know it ’ s so hard to give up the old habit like smoking .  Speaker1:  but you should make up your mind first .  Speaker2:  you know i often have to work far into the night . i need smoking to keep me awake .  Speaker1:  why don ’ t you go to bed early and get up early ? you ’ ll have the same time for work .

Speaker2:  i wouldn ’ t miss it for the world ! it ’ s sure to be fun . she ’ s invited a lot of people . do you think everyone will be able to get into her house ?

Speaker2:  no . if you do that , the workers won ’ t like their jobs . they will be less efficient and you will get a high staff turnover . those things will increase you costs .  Speaker1:  how can a business maximise revenues ?

Speaker1:  i guess i ’ ll just have to tell mr . robinson that you ’ re too busy every evening – doing god knows what . . . god don ’ t go on like this . if you absolutely refuse to take her out . . .

Speaker1:  what do you mean ?  Speaker2:  i mean in the library , or in some information center . often the university hires foreign students for part - time positions .  Speaker1:  yes , i know . i tried that . they don ' t have anything now . so what can i do ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  well , since you ' re a foreign student , it ' s hard . that ' s because it ' s actually illegal for you to work in america .  Speaker1:  i know that . you don ' t have to tell me that . that ' s my problem . i know i have the right to work for the university . that ' s legal . but they don ' t have a job for me . and it ' s illegal for me to get a job elsewhere .  Speaker2:  anyway , there must be some solution . you know there are many people working illegally in new york .  Speaker1:  but i need a pretty decent job . i need to make enough to pay my rent at least . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  i have an idea .  Speaker1:  what ?  Speaker2:  since you ' re chinese , maybe you can find part - time work in chinatown .  Speaker1:  i already had that idea .  Speaker2:  well , why don ' t you go and look down there ?  Speaker1:  but i don ' t know what i would do .  Speaker2:  it may be part - time work as a waitress or something . it would be illegal , but sometimes waitresses make a good salary .  Speaker1:  maybe . i don ' t know .
 |

 | 
Speaker1: hey claire , you ' ve been really quiet these last few days . is something wrong ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  i ' ve been really stressed . it ' s the end of the year and i ' ve got so much stuff to do ! i feel like i ' m drowning in work .  Speaker1:  well , stress is a real thing . it ' s not an imaginary condition .  Speaker2:  it ' s seriously affecting my life ! i can ' t sleep , i don ' t have much of an appetite and my husband says i ' ve been kind of short tempered . other people seem to handle stress okay . . . why am i so weak ?  Speaker1:  you ' re not weak . . . you ' re stressed out ! stress has been a part of the human condition for millions of years . back when we still lived in the trees we had to watch out for predators . . . and as you might imagine , that was pretty stressful .  Speaker2:  yeah , but i don ' t see any tigers or leopards roaming around our office . my stress is just about silly paperwork !  Speaker1:  but you ' re actually having the same reaction as our tree - dwelling ancestors ! it ' s called the flight or fight response . each time you feel like something ' s threatening you , your body decides whether to run away or fight . . . it causes all sorts of chemical reactions in the body .  Speaker2:  so a deadline will cause that same reaction ?  Speaker1:  it could . modern humans actually have more flight or fight responses than our ancestors did . they just had a couple of close calls every day , but today , we have dozens or even hundreds !

Speaker1: hey , mary , what ' s up ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  not much . last night i met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time that we decided to meet again tonight .  Speaker1:  oh , that ' s exciting . what ' s this guy like ? is he hot ?  Speaker2:  well , i ddin ' t think so at first . but as we started talking , i found him extremely funny and witty . i couldn ' t stop laughing at his jokes ! we have so much in common . we like the same teams , music , and most amazingly , we both love chinese food ! i have the feeling that we are going to be great friends .  Speaker1:  it seems you two are a good match . what qualities do you look for in a friend ?  Speaker2:  there ' s nothing definite i think . i don ' t have a list or anything , but when i first meet somebody , i can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend . it seems i have a radar helping me spot new friends .  Speaker1:  well , that ' s something i ' ve never heard of . but if you ask me what i value most in a friend , i would have to say honesty .
 | 
Speaker1: i must be going now .  Speaker2:  really ? can ' t you stay a little longer ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  no , i really must go now . my family are expecting me home soon .

Speaker1: when you are in a restaurant you want the waiter to bring the bill , what do you do to attract his attention ?  Speaker2:  i just make eye contact with him and nod my head . then i tell him when he comes over to the table . why do you ask ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  i went out with my girlfriend to a nice restaurant last night and i noticed that many people shouted for the bill .  Speaker2:  that seems a little impolite in such a restaurant .  Speaker1:  that ’ s what i thought . i just thought i ’ d ask you and see what you thought of it . anyway , what did you do yesterday evening ?  Speaker2:  well , it was a warm evening , so i stretched my legs . i walked along the canal for a couple of miles . actually , several other people had the same idea . i saw bill . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  did you ? how is he these days ?  Speaker2:  he seemed ok . we didn ’ t stop and chat because we were on opposite banks of the canal . we just waved at each other .  Speaker1:  i need to move some furniture . could you help me to lift it ?
 | 
Speaker1: guess what ?
 |

Speaker1:  money is no object . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  our most elegant flower is golden lily . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  i will take ten .

Speaker2:  okay . nope , it ' s a replay of yesterday ' s soccer match between brazil and spain .  Speaker1:  it was a good game , but not good enough to watch again . keep surfing .  Speaker2:  alright . hmm , this movie is a rerun . . . i don ' t know how many times i ' ve seen this show . . . commercial again . . . and a replay of the talk show . . . oh no , this show is terrible , you don ' t wanna watch it .  Speaker1:  oh , what is it ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  it ' s a total rip - off of an american reality show , but the imitation is unbearably clumsy .  Speaker1:  oh , i know this kind of shows . sometimes they really piss me off . if i wanted reality , i ' d go outside .  Speaker2:  yeah . . . it seems what we have on tv now are either repeats , or commercials , or low - quality shows . there ' s really nothing to watch .  Speaker1:  i don ' t get it . we have more than 100 channels and there ' s still nothing good on ! maybe we should just turn off the tv , get outside , and do something real .

Speaker1:  so you didn ’ t . is that right ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  yes . i ’ m sorry . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  why didn ’ t you just answer my question directly ? why would chinese answer questions this way ? i simply asked if you did it or not . it ’ s a very simple question . and chinese often give the reason before they would give a direct answer .  Speaker2:  yes , i ’ m sorry . i know it bothers you very much . but i don ’ t know why chinese sometimes would do this .  Speaker1:  you know , today i asked a student if he brought his dictionary with him . it ’ s a rule i made for the class that everyone brings a bilingual dictionary with them because sometimes they don ’ t understand me . the funniest thing is that this student gave me a lot of reasons and no direct answer .

Speaker1:  that sounds about right to me , fifty cents a bag . if they think you don ’ t know better , they ’ ll try to get more .  Speaker2:  it ’ s the same in balloon . but i definitely think we over - tipped the cab driver . the fare was twenty dollars , and you gave him a five - dollar tip . that ’ s twenty - five percent of the total ! too much !  Speaker1:  i disagree . he was polite and informative , and he drove smoothly . one should reward good service .

 | 
Speaker1: have you adapted to the lifestyle in china ?  Speaker2:  yeah , almost . but there is one thing .  Speaker1:  what ?  Speaker2:  i still wonder what privacy meant for chinese people . i don ' t mean to say that there ' s no privacy in china , but . . .  Speaker1:  what is it ?  Speaker2:  some of my chinese colleagues just share their personal stories in front of others .  Speaker1:  that makes you feel uncomfortable ?  Speaker2:  yeah . we never do that in a public office .  Speaker1:  perhaps that ' s because we hold different ideas about privacy .  Speaker2:  i have felt that . one day when i was in a queue , reading a newspaper story , the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper i was holding .  Speaker1:  well , that ' s not rare . i ' ve seen people reading at others ' newspaper while taking a metro or a bus .  Speaker2:  just stare at the newspaper holding in the hands of the one next to him ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  yeah .

Speaker1: what ' s your apartment like ?  Speaker2:  it ' s furnished two bedroom flat in a three - story building on campus .  Speaker1:  what is it like living in on - campus housing ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  it ' s not as bad as i thought it would be . the freshmen that live nearby are really loud , especially on the weekends . but , the rent is much cheaper than private housing , so it ' s worth it .  Speaker1:  did you have to pay a deposit ?  Speaker2:  no , but we do have to pay 9 months rent in 6 months , so for the first months we pay 1 / 2 month ' s rent each month .  Speaker1:  do you have to pay utilities on top of your monthly rent ?  Speaker2:  no , it ' s all included . besides , students don ' t have to pay council tax , so we ' re saving quite bit of money by living here . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  how long is your contract for ?

 | 
Speaker1: you should have seen the t . v . show that was on last night , the topic it covered was really interesting , animal rights . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  do you really believe in that ? if they are going to focus on something , they should do it on civil rights .  Speaker1:  yes , but we can ’ t deny that animals are vulnerable , defenseless , and are completely at the mercy of human beings .  Speaker2:  i understand your point , but we continue to have transgressions against human rights . if so much attention weren ’ t devoted to the topic of animals , we would then concentrate more on saving a human being instead of protecting a koala .  Speaker1:  you can ’ t compare apples and oranges . i believe that both topics are important and that we can ’ t ignore them , the mistreatment of animals can cause a great environmental imbalance . i believe that governments should prohibit activities like poaching .
 | 
Speaker1: excuse me . may i take a picture of you and your little boy ?  Speaker2:  what ’ s it for ?  Speaker1:  it ’ s for a book .

Speaker2:  what should i take first ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  that chair over there , but please be careful with it . it was a gift from my mother - in - law .  Speaker2:  don ' t worry , i won ' t drop it . wow , it ' s really heavy . i don ' t think i can move it by myself . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  let me help you with that . i don ' t want you to hurt your back .

Speaker1: how ' s it going ?  Speaker2:  i ' m in a good mood today , actually . how about you ?  Speaker1:  to be honest , i ' m a bit fed up .  Speaker2:  what ' s wrong ?  Speaker1:  there ' s a girl in my company that i really like but i always get shy when she is around .  Speaker2:  i see ! do you want to ask her out ?  Speaker1:  sure , but how ?  Speaker2:  you can ask her out for drink after work .  Speaker1:  but for what reasons ? she doesn ' t even know who i am .  Speaker2:  then you ' ve got a lot of homework to do . you need to get her notice first . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  easier said than done . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  you can start by meeting her at the bus stop and saying hello to her .  Speaker1:  but i always get tongue - tied when i see her .  Speaker2:  that ' s something you need to overcome . men should make the first move as most of girls prefer being chased . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  i see . i ' ll try .
 | 
Speaker1: it ' s getting late . i ' m afraid i have to leave . thank you for a most wonderful evening .

Speaker2:  no , he ' s still sleeping .  Speaker1:  wow , it ' s already 10 : 00 am . he must have been up late last night . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  yeah , he didn ' t come home until 12 : 00 am .  Speaker1:  i hope he can come later .  Speaker2:  i hope so too . i ' ll give him a call when we get there .  Speaker1:  how do we get to the library from here ?
 | 
Speaker1: hi , lucy , you are very popular with people around you , what are your tricks ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  thank you for saying so . i don ’ t know , probably because i like sharing my experience and knowledge with them . i think this kind of communication helps to improve our work efficiency and also helps to get along with colleagues .  Speaker1:  sharing knowledge can be very settled and some second stances . people may think you are telling them how to do their work . if they take it personally , they feel angry at you and even become reluctant to support you at work .  Speaker2:  that is true . some people will misunderstand your intention and lets you do it in the long threatening way . for example , it is not sensible at all to arguing with the others or correcting someone in front of other people . to show your friendliness and willingness to share is much more important than to show off .  Speaker1:  you are quite right . thank you for sharing your experience with me . i learned a lot .

Speaker1: how was your education going on in australia ?  Speaker2:  i ' m going to graduate this summer .

Speaker1:  why are you choosing to leave a foreign country ? many people are reluctant to leave the superior living environment abroad .  Speaker2:  well , i think personal development is much more important than simply having a superior living environment .  Speaker1:  yeah , china ' s developing so fast and development opportunities can be found almost in every corner of the country .  Speaker2:  absolutely , many chinese enterprises are going global , and they are in great need of excellent returnees to help them with their overseas business .  Speaker1:  the rapidly expanding economy has encouraged many students to pack their bags amd head for home .

Speaker1: how do you like this dress ?  Speaker2:  it ' s nice . but what kind of dress are you looking for ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  something attractive and dressy . maybe a little sexy too . new year ' s eve is a special occasion and it only happens once a year , right ?  Speaker2:  of course . it ' s common too that we wear something special for our chinese new year .  Speaker1:  people here always wear the best clothes they have . many people go out and buy clothes especially for new year ' s eve .  Speaker2:  any other common customs of your new year ?  Speaker1:  before the new year , we always send greeting cards to our relatives and friends to wish them a happy year . on the street and in stores people usually greet others with a ' happy new year ' . it ' s also common for people to make a new year ' s resolution . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  what ' s that ?  Speaker1:  it ' s when people quit a bad habit or do something they find hard to do . many people resolve to quit smoking , lose weight , or stop nagging their wife , etc . however , it usually lasts only for a few days !  Speaker2:  by the way , where are you going on new year ' s eve ?

Speaker2:  she was great . in today ’ s class , she gave us a lecture on how to be a good student . she told us not to arm for exams , and to pay more attention on communicating than memorizing . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  where is she from ?  Speaker2:  she said that she ’ s from a small town in the middle of america .  Speaker1:  were you able to understand everything that she said ?  Speaker2:  not everything , but nearly . she speaks very clearly and doesn ’ t use very complex words so that it is easy for us to understand her .  Speaker1:  she sounds like a good teacher . do you think you ’ ll pass her class ?  Speaker2:  yes . . . with flying colors !  Speaker1:  what does that mean ?  Speaker2:  it ’ s a new phrase that she taught us today . it means that i will not only pass the class , but i will do extremely well !  Speaker1:  if you like the class this much already , i ’ m sure you will .  Speaker2:  i hope so .  Speaker1:  did she give you any homework ?

Speaker1:  serious ? only the proof of my address .  Speaker2:  yes , i am afraid she gave you the wrong information .  Speaker1:  but it ’ s unfair .  Speaker2:  well , i sympathize with your problem , but , to be honest , i don ’ t think there is any thing anyone can do for you . you were trapped in the system . if you want , you can talk to the director . she will help you if she can . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  great .

Speaker2:  really ? do i look happy all the time ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  all i know is you look quite differently from other teachers .  Speaker2:  oh , do you know why ? actually , it ’ s easy . because i always exercise . my exercise , i think , is very hard . i often feel very good after conquering these difficulties . i feel alive !  Speaker1:  oh , i know . i saw you doing pull - ups one time on the campus and some students trying to imitate you .  Speaker2:  yeah , they are doing it for fun . seldom would people like my exercise . it ’ s difficult and boring .  Speaker1:  it ’ s true . many students do the exercise when they have to . we have p . e . once a week .  Speaker2:  but i think chinese students need to exercise more . besides exercise will help them learn new things better . don ’ t students want to have a good memory ?  Speaker1:  of course . i didn ’ t know that . i only know exercise makes bodies stronger . i should take some exercise then . do you have any suggestions ?

Speaker1:  you changed jobs again ? why do you move so frequently ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  i want to try different things before i find the one i really like .  Speaker1:  why don ' t you stick with one job for a bit longer ?  Speaker2:  i could handle everything pretty well in the old position , so i decided to move around and learn something new . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  how ' s your current job going ?
 | 
Speaker1: do you have a boyfriend ?  Speaker2:  yes . why ?  Speaker1:  well , i came to know a girl 3 weeks ago and we have so much in common .  Speaker2:  so ?  Speaker1:  so i think i may fall in love with her .  Speaker2:  you are attracted to her . that sounds great , but how do you know that it is a crush or it ' s real love ?  Speaker1:  then what ' s the difference between having a crush and falling in love ?  Speaker2:  that ' s a big question . well , if you are in love , maybe you ’ ll take every opportunity to talk to her or telephone her for no reason at all .  Speaker1:  that ' s what i did .  Speaker2:  and you think about her all the time ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  yes . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  and maybe you suddenly have new interests . i mean you suddenly begin to do things you used to avoid , ie . you used to sleep in every morning , but because she jogs every morning , then you begin to like jogging .  Speaker1:  that ' s it . she likes dogs so much now , and i begin to love dogs .  Speaker2:  oh , congratulations ! sounds like you ’ ve found your soul mate .  Speaker1:  thanks . but i know falling in love is one thing , while staying in love is another .  Speaker2:  yeah , that ' s right . if you find this person is more and more important to you and you can totally trust her , then you can stay in love .  Speaker1:  yeah . falling in love is so good !

Speaker1: if you wanna keep healthy , you must give up smoking . it ' s extremely bad for your health , you know . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  i know it ' s not good for me , but the problem is i just can ' t help it .  Speaker1:  well , i ' ve got an idea , put the label cancer sticks on each pack of cigarettes , and read it before you smoke . it may give you a feeling to reduce it .

 | 
Speaker1: wake up , erik , time to rise and shine .  Speaker2:  huh , oh , hi , jane . i must have fallen asleep while i was reading .  Speaker1:  you and everyone else . it looks more like a camp - ground than a library .  Speaker2:  well , the dorm ’ s too noisy to study in , and i guess this place is too quiet .  Speaker1:  have you had any luck finding a topic for your paper ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  no . prof . grant told us to write about anything in cultural anthropology . for once i wish she hadn ’ t given us so much of a choice .  Speaker1:  well , why not write about the ancient civilizations of mexico . you seem to be interested in that part of the world .  Speaker2:  i am , but there is too much material to cover . i ’ ll be writing forever , and grant only wants five to seven pages .  Speaker1:  so they limit it to one region of mexico . say the yucatan . you ’ ve been there and you said it ’ s got lots of interesting relics .
 | 
Speaker1: i really like my debate class .  Speaker2:  do you think you ' ll be interested in studying law later ?  Speaker1:  i ' ve entertained the idea . but i ' m i leaning more toward politics .  Speaker2:  you want to be a politician ? yuck .  Speaker1:  that ' s not like you to generalize .  Speaker2:  sorry , you ' re right . i think you ' ll be a good politician . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  i think i can do a lot of good for our country .
 | 
Speaker1: i dare you to talk to that girl .

 | 
Speaker1: the last thing i want to see is to lose face before my friends . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  that ’ s really unbearable . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  but you know , things cannot always go as you expect .
 | 
Speaker1: have you ever thought about having children , kaitlyn ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  my husband and i have thought about it , but we ’ ve decided not to have any . they are just too expensive . besides , with all the news about global warming on the news lately , who knows what kind of world we ’ ll have in the future . what about you ?  Speaker1:  well , i ’ ve always wanted to have lots of children . growing up with only one brother , i always felt a bit lonely . what do you think about families with only one child ?  Speaker2:  for me , growing up in a big family always made me yearn for attention . i always wanted to be an only child so that i could always do what i wanted and so that i wouldn ’ t ever have to share .  Speaker1:  don ’ t you think you would miss having other people around ?  Speaker2:  no way ! i spent 20 years of my life with relatives around me 24 - 7 . you know , i don ’ t think i ’ ve ever actually spent any time by myself in my parents ’ home . what do you think of the one - child policy in china ?  Speaker1:  if china didn ’ t have such a policy , can you imagine how many people there would be in china now ?  Speaker2:  that ’ s true . but as a woman , i ’ m glad that even though i don ’ t want any children , i at least have a choice in how many children i have . on the other hand , i can ’ t imagine what china would be like if there weren ’ t a one - child policy !  Speaker1:  do you think most families with many children envy or feel sorry for other families with only one child ?
 | 
Speaker1: i ' m sorry i ' m late .  Speaker2:  oh , that ' s all right . i just wondered what was keeping you .  Speaker1:  the bus i took .  Speaker2:  what do you mean ?  Speaker1:  i took the wrong bus .
 | 
Speaker1: hi , anna . i haven ’ t seen you for ages . where have you been ?  Speaker2:  i ’ ve been away on holidays for sometime .  Speaker1:  no wonder i haven ’ t seen you recently . where did you spend your holidays ?  Speaker2:  i went with my husband . our first stop was bangkok . we stayed there for 5 days . then we flew to hong kong , stopover for 3 days . our last stop was china . we visited the great wall . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  you must have a wonderful time .

 | 
Speaker1: is there a lot of crime in your city ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  there ’ s some , but i don ’ t think it ’ s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime , burglary and car theft . there ’ s very little major crime .  Speaker1:  it ’ s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .  Speaker2:  that happens in many places . in my city , there is a very good drug rehabilitation programme . the police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes , but i don ’ t know if that ’ s the reason for  Speaker1:  some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .
 | 
Speaker1: why do you like this computer ?
 | 
Speaker1: what can i do for you today ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  i need to return a book . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  can i do anything else for you ?

Speaker1: good game ?  Speaker2:  not bad . but too hot for me today .  Speaker1:  yes , i know . kind of hard to concentrate , isn ' t it ?  Speaker2:  absolutely . who were you playing with ?  Speaker1:  oh , just on my own . i just joined , so i don ' t really have any partners .  Speaker2:  really ? oh , well , in that case we should play together some time . what ' s your handicap ?  Speaker1:  16 . yours ?  Speaker2:  no kidding ! i ' m 16 , too . we should definitely play together some time . my name ' s bob . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  jane . nice to meet you .  Speaker2:  me too . so , do you like the course ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  yes , it ' s fine . however , i personally think the fairways between the greens are a bit too long , especially for such a hot climate . don ' t they have carts ?  Speaker2:  well , they used to , but they got rid of them because of environmental concerns .  Speaker1:  oh , that ' s good . i guess the caddies were pleased .  Speaker2:  actually , in my opinion , the carts were better because you don ' t have to tip them .  Speaker1:  yes , but look at it this way , getting rid of the carts probably gives more work to local people , which is a good thing , right ?  Speaker2:  possibly , but i still miss them ! what bothers me is that the heat makes the caddies ' life quite hard . one member ' s caddy fainted last week !  Speaker1:  how awful , poor guy .  Speaker2:  right . luckily it was on the eighteen hole , quite near the clubhouse , so he didn ' t have far to carry him . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  oh , my god , you ' re kidding me ! he carried him back ?
 | 
Speaker1: can i get you something to drink ?  Speaker2:  no , that ' s okay , i already have a coke . why don ' t you have a seat , you look like you ' ve been on your feet all day .  Speaker1:  i guess i could take a break . so , how do you like denver ?  Speaker2:  it ' s great ! the mountains here are beautiful and the skiing is spectacular . have you been here for a long time ?  Speaker1:  about six years . . .  Speaker2:  what do you do for a living ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  i manage one of the ski lodges . it ' s a great job , i can spend a lot of my time outdoors , and i also get to ski for free all season .

Speaker1: what are you doing ?  Speaker2:  i ’ m just looking at this map of the world . i ’ m preparing for a geography class .  Speaker1:  there are no countries marked on the map . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  no , there aren ’ t . this map just show the geographical features . look at the himalayan plateau with the highest peaks in the world .  Speaker1:  the thing that i find most surprising is that most of the world is covered with water . compared to the oceans , most countries are tiny .  Speaker2:  i find it incredible how millions of years of volcanic activity have created mountains thousands of metres tall .  Speaker1:  rivers have created deep valleys and canyons like the grand can you .

Speaker1: i ' m sorry , i ' m having a little trouble understanding your accent .
 | 
Speaker1: what ' s your favourite steps ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  it ' s hard to say . but i do love waltz very much .  Speaker1:  how about rumba ?  Speaker2:  to tell the truth , i don ' t like it .  Speaker1:  really ? you must like tango , right ?  Speaker2:  oh , it ' s really beautiful , but i just can ' t dance it well .  Speaker1:  don ' t be so modest . i ' m sure you can dance it very well . let ' s dance it now . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  ok . i ' ll have a try .  Speaker1:  oh , you dance it so well .

Speaker1: why do you look so sad ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  i ’ m in pretty bad shape . i am having an allergy all the time . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  why not go and see a doctor ?

Speaker2:  how did you feel when you graduated ?  Speaker1:  it was a round day for me . my family attend the graduation ceremony . i was so nervous . i couldn ' t find my cap and gown , but all worked out in the end .  Speaker2:  what did you do after graduation ?  Speaker1:  i was planning to attend gradate school , but then i was offered a good job doing marketing , so i changed my mind . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  sounds like you ' re happy with your decision . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  i sure am . so what about you ? how did you feel when you graduated ?  Speaker2:  it was also a proud day for me , but i also felt like a kind of loss that day . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  how could it be ?

Speaker1: how should we commemorate the centenary of the founding of the university ? we have been given quite a large budget to pay for some events .  Speaker2:  we should certainly hold a big party for the professors and students . we could have a firework display .  Speaker1:  do you think that we should invite alumni and former professors ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  if we do , too many people might attend . perhaps we should invited all of them , but make a small charge to attend .  Speaker1:  good idea . we should also hold a series of presentations . we could have presentations on the history of the university , the courses we offer , and our links with other universities .  Speaker2:  good idea ! i think we could also have presentations by former students on how their experience here helped them in their lives .  Speaker1:  we could have another on the successes of graduates from here .  Speaker2:  i think that we could also produce some merchandise for the centenary - you know , t - shirts , mugs , plates , pens , and things like that .  Speaker1:  that ’ s an excellent idea . hopefully , we would be able to make a profit ! a few professors and students are writing a book on the history of the university .  Speaker2:  i ’ m looking forward to reading that . we could have book signings by famous professors an alumni .  Speaker1:  a group of students from the art and music faculty are producing a short film .

Speaker1: have you considered upgrading your system ?  Speaker2:  yes , but i ' m not sure what exactly i would need .  Speaker1:  you could consider adding a painting program to your software . it would allow you to make up your own flyers and banners for advertising . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  that would be a definite bonus . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  you might also want to upgrade your hardware because it is pretty outdated now . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  how can we do that ?  Speaker1:  you ' d probably need a faster processor , to begin with . and you also need a more powerful hard disc , more memory and a faster modem . do you have a cd - rom drive ?  Speaker2:  no .  Speaker1:  then you might want to add a cd - rom drive too , because most new software programs are coming out on cds .

Speaker1:  but we ' re going to spend so much money in furnishing and decorating . i think we could get a much cheaper place that ' s already furnished .  Speaker2:  but don ' t you like this place ? i remember when we came to see it we thought it would be lovely .  Speaker1:  well , only you liked it really , darling .
 |

Speaker1:  actually , i ’ m interested in all of them . the more choices we have , the harder to make a decision .

Speaker2:  can you help me ? you know i do need the scholarship . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  i ' m afraid i can ' t i advise you to try again next year .
 | 
Speaker1: how can i lose weight , doctor ? i seem to get fatter even when i just look at food ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  well , jim . it is a combination of how much you eat , the type of food you eat , and when you eat your meals .  Speaker1:  i never eat breakfast though .  Speaker2:  that ' s a big mistake , you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel , and as well you won ' t expect your body to work without food .  Speaker1:  i never thought about it that way .  Speaker2:  i bet you eat a large evening meal , then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your energy , your body stores it as fat .  Speaker1:  oh doctor , i feel so foolish .
 | 
Speaker1: i am confused . how could a golfer need so many clubs ? seems to me , 14 altogether , right  Speaker2:  i should say , a a ' set ' of golf clubs is restricted to no more than 14 clubs .  Speaker1:  then what makes a ' set ' of clubs ?  Speaker2:  in general , a set of golf clubs 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , pw ; woods : 1 , 3 , 5 and a putter .  Speaker1:  so many ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  this is not to say you have to carry all of these clubs . it depends on your preferences . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  have you heard of tiger woods ?
 | 
Speaker1: do you remember john from head office ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  yes . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  have you heard what happened to him ?  Speaker2:  no , what ?  Speaker1:  he had his car stolen . actually he was kidnapped while he was in the car .  Speaker2:  what do you mean ?  Speaker1:  well , apparently , he was just getting into his car - he ' d parked it in one of those underground multi - story things - he was just getting in and suddenly three guys with guns opened the back doors of the car and got in .  Speaker2:  crikey . where did this happen ?  Speaker1:  in taichung , i think .  Speaker2:  oh , right , i hear they have a lot of this kind of problem down there .  Speaker1:  really ? well , anyway , they pointed their guns at him and said , you know , keep calm and drive out . . . . we don ' t want to hurt you . . . we just want your car .  Speaker2:  so what happened ?  Speaker1:  well , he drove out , and when he got to the booth to pay the attendant , he pretended to have an epileptic fit , you know , to scare the thieves away . the attendant was no help at all , even though the guys were holding guns in plain view , he did nothing .  Speaker2:  that ' s terrible .  Speaker1:  yes , makes you think , doesn ' t it ?  Speaker2:  so what happened next ?  Speaker1:  well , he kept on pretending to have a fit , so they freaked out and just ran away .
 |

 | 
Speaker1: do you still see the people we went to school with ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  i did for a while , i suppose , until i left university , but after that not really .

Speaker1:  ok , i suppose , but she ' s had a rough time in the last few years , she got divorced .
 | 
Speaker1: i hear that helen does not relate very well to her husband .

Speaker1:  out of those what is your favorite ?  Speaker2:  my favorite is to play computer games .  Speaker1:  what is your favorite computer game ?  Speaker2:  my favorite is diablo . it used to be star craft , but it is getting a little old .  Speaker1:  if you like to play so much , when do you ever exercise ?  Speaker2:  although i hate to exercise , i go jogging at least twice a week . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  that ' s pretty good . by the way , what are you doing next saturday ?  Speaker2:  i am going to go to the bookstore .  Speaker1:  i am having a party saturday night at my house . if you have time , you should come .  Speaker2:  that sounds like fun .  Speaker1:  great . i ' ll see you on saturday .

 | 
Speaker1: shall we sing with a karaoke ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  great idea ! i do it every so often . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  for us , karaoke is becoming a popular entertainment .  Speaker2:  yep . if you are a good singer , your audience will feel comfortable , right ?  Speaker1:  i can not agree with you more . and if you are an awful one , that will be funny .  Speaker2:  i remembered tom is always out of tune . we burst into laughter . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  is that true ? shall we invite him to join with us ?
 | 
Speaker1: i ' m afraid i can ' t complete my paper on time .  Speaker2:  what happened ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  i keep on meeting with difficulties in the experiment . i can hardly go on .
 | 
Speaker1: have you heard jenny divorced her french husband ?  Speaker2:  oh , really ? no wonder that she looks quite depressed recently .  Speaker1:  yes . they used to be joined at the hip . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  i heard they were just married for half a year .  Speaker1:  that ’ s true . she said they often argued over nickel - and - dime things .  Speaker2:  yeah . mixed marriage is tempting but full of culture shock .  Speaker1:  you said it . you know , they fell in love at the first sight and quickly jumped into marriage .
 | 
Speaker1: where do you usually do your shopping , mrs . lane ?  Speaker2:  i usually go to the supermarket , near the station .  Speaker1:  how do you find the prices there ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  i think they are quite reasonable , and the vegetables are very fresh .  Speaker1:  i see you have bought some coffee . would you mind telling me how much you paid for it ?
 | 
Speaker1: hello , what can i do for you ?  Speaker2:  i am looking for a host home .  Speaker1:  how long will you stay with the host family ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  well , at least half a year . do i have to do my own grocery shopping ?  Speaker1:  usually the host family prepares at least two meals a day for you .
 | 
Speaker1: i cannot understand why she always helps and supports her brother .  Speaker2:  why do you say so ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  because he is often in trouble .
 | 
Speaker1: did you find what you were looking for ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  i tried when you had gone , but i had no luck . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  okay , let ' s both look for it now .

Speaker1:  oh . what about saturday ? are you free then ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  saturday my parents are coming to town . what ' s up ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  what about tonight ? do you have plans tonight ?  Speaker2:  no . did you want to go do something ?  Speaker1:  yes ! yes ! i want to take you to dinner .
 | 
Speaker1: there ' s a typhoon coming .
 | 
Speaker1: do you want to go out for dinner tonight ?  Speaker2:  sure . have you got anywhere in mind ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  i ' m starving , so maybe we could go somewhere with large portions .  Speaker2:  that italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions . do you want to go there ?  Speaker1:  i ' m not really in the mood for italian , actually . i was thinking of something a bit spicy .  Speaker2:  if you want spicy food , then i ' d recommend going to a thai , indian or chinese restaurant . how about that chinese buffet on cowley road ?  Speaker1:  i really like that restaurant ; you get a lot for your money there . but , they ' ve westernized their food , so it ' s not actually that spicy .  Speaker2:  you ' re right . most of their dishes have sweet sauces . we could try that indian restaurant just down the road from us .  Speaker1:  the taj ? they ' re a bit expensive , but they do serve large portions of very hot food .  Speaker2:  the taj it is then .  Speaker1:  shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money ?  Speaker2:  they ' ll still charge us a corkage fee . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  that ' s right . it ' ll probably work out to be about the same then anyway .  Speaker2:  don ' t worry about money . i ' ll treat you tonight .  Speaker1:  are you sure ? we could go dutch .
 | 
Speaker1: hello martin . have you been to any events yet ?

 | 
Speaker1: hello .  Speaker2:  hi .  Speaker1:  how are you ?  Speaker2:  i ' m good . how are you ?  Speaker1:  good . do you speak english ?  Speaker2:  a little . are you american ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  yes . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  where are you from ?  Speaker1:  i ' m from california .

 | 
Speaker1: what do you think of the olympic motto ' higher , faster and stronger ' ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  well , it ' s better than ' friendship first , competition second ' .  Speaker1:  why ? in my opinion , it doesn ' t matter whether you won or not . the most important thing is participation .
 | 
Speaker1: so chris , i ' ve heard that you ' re from a big family . how many people ?  Speaker2:  nine total . seven children and my parents .  Speaker1:  seven children ? that ' s a lot . why did your parents have so many ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  well , my mother came from a big family , and wanted to have one of her own . my father was an only child , and didn ' t really care about having a large family , but my mother talked him into it .  Speaker1:  jeez , seven children . that must have a lot of problems . we have four children in my family and my grandparents can never get our names right .  Speaker2:  it can be hard , and there are certain sacrifices you have to make .  Speaker1:  like what ? i assume that there ' s no privacy .  Speaker2:  that ' s one . another is the lack of personal property . everything you have , from toys to clothes , is used by your brothers and sisters . especially clothes . three quarters of my wardrobe are hand - me - downs .  Speaker1:  and the age gap is also annoying . there ' s a ten - year difference between my younger brother and me . we have nothing in common .
 | 
Speaker1: john , if you don ' t mind , i ' d like to ask you a personal question . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  i don ' t mind at all . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  all right . are you married ?  Speaker2:  to tell you the truth , i ' m not married . i ' m still single .  Speaker1:  then , when do you plan to get married ?

Speaker2:  i ' ve got a letter from my bank here . it shows i am able to support myself during these three years of studies . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  could i see that , please ?  Speaker2:  yes , here it is .  Speaker1:  thanks very much . well , i ' ll be able to give you a visa for one year , a student visa , that is .  Speaker2:  oh , but mine is a three - year program .  Speaker1:  yes , it is a three - year , but you can renew the visa each year in the states . it is our usual procedure .
 | 
Speaker1: it ' s a lovely day out today , isn ' t it ?  Speaker2:  it ' s beautiful . enjoy it while it lasts . it ' s supposed to get cold tomorrow .  Speaker1:  what ' s the weather forecast for tomorrow ?  Speaker2:  it ' s supposed to snow early tomorrow morning and then tomorrow afternoon there ' s a chance of freezing rain .  Speaker1:  that doesn ' t sound pretty .  Speaker2:  do you have any plans for tomorrow ?  Speaker1:  well , i was going to drive to birmingham to see some friends .  Speaker2:  you might want to change your plans . with the cold and wet weather that we ' re supposed to have tomorrow , the roads are going to be rather slippery .  Speaker1:  i suppose i should . i don ' t like driving in dangerous weather conditions . do you have any plans for tomorrow ?  Speaker2:  i just have to go to class tomorrow afternoon .  Speaker1:  if you ' re lucky , it ' ll get cancelled and you can have a snow day !  Speaker2:  if that happens , then i ' ll invite you over and we can drink hot cocoa and watch movies . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  that sounds like fun .

Speaker1:  are there any other cities where it ' s always hot ?  Speaker2:  many . most of the cities in the southern part of the united states are hot all year .  Speaker1:  but why do so many people live there ?  Speaker2:  most people grow accustomed to the climate , but there are many others who complain about it all the time .  Speaker1:  are there any cities where it rains a lot ?  Speaker2:  several . two good examples are seattle , in the state of washington , and portland , oregon .  Speaker1:  tell us about some cold cities .  Speaker2:  in the north there are many cities which are very cold in the winter . boston and chicago are two of them .  Speaker1:  is it always cold in chicago and boston ?
 | 
Speaker1: mark , you are not telling me the truth . now why ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  promise you are not going to be angry ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  yes , all right . so why ? go on then . say it . oh , really , mark . i promise i ' m not going to be angry . now why were you late ?

Speaker2:  no . why ?  Speaker1:  how about a coffee in that cafe ?
 | 
Speaker1: i ' m really fed up with larry ! he ' s the biggest airhead i ' ve ever met . he always makes careless mistakes , and he ' s a pain to work with . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  you shouldn ' t be so negative . you ' ll always have some co - workers that are harder to work with than others . but if you are negative and start name - calling in the office , it will make a bad working environment for everybody .  Speaker1:  you only say that because you don ' t have to work with him . the people in your department seem so capable and nice to be around . take mary for example . she ' s smart and enthusiastic . i ' ve never met anyone as cheery as she is .  Speaker2:  everybody has their strengths and weaknesses . even larry . he might be a pain to be around , but he ' s also very good at staying in budget on projects . mary , on the other hand , spends our project money like there ' s no tomorrow . also , she ' s never willing to stay a little later at the office . she always leaves at 5pm sharp .  Speaker1:  isn ' t there anyone in the office that is a perfect co - worker ? what about bob ? everybody loves bob . even though he ' s flesh out of college and still a bit green , he is a great co - worker .

Speaker1: hello everyone , and welcome to our cpr for beginners course . first of all , does anyone know what cpr stands for ?  Speaker2:  cardiopulmonary resuscitation !  Speaker1:  that ’ s right ! we apply cpr in the case of cardiac arrest or pulmonary arrest .  Speaker2:  what does that mean ?  Speaker1:  well , basically if your heart stops pumping blood , or your lungs stop pumping air , then we need to get them going again ! that ’ s when we have to apply this procedure . let ’ s begin ! i need a volunteer .  Speaker2:  me ! me ! _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  alright , come here and lay flat on your back . let ’ s suppose this young woman has stopped breathing . we must lift the person ’ s chin so that we clear a pathway for air to get into the lungs . then we place our mouth over the other person ’ s mouth and blow air two or three times , like this .  Speaker2:  wait , what are you doing ? i ’ m a married woman ! you can ’ t just try to kiss me like this !  Speaker1:  madam i ’ m not trying to kiss you ! i am trying to demonstrate how to apply cpr in the case of an emergency .  Speaker2:  well , ok . but no french kissing !  Speaker1:  as i was saying , we blow air through the mouth in this manner . once this is done , we must try to get the heart going again . to do this , we place our hands over the person ’ s chest , and press down firmly two or three times .

Speaker1: how long will it take us to drive to london ?  Speaker2:  i think it ’ s a distance of 180 kilometers from here to london , so it should be a two - hour drive on the motorway .  Speaker1:  that ’ s unless there is a traffic jam . it could take three hours .  Speaker2:  you ’ re right . we will be able to travel at high speeds at the beginning and end of the journey , because we will be in built - up area .  Speaker1:  so , shall we allow three hours to cover the distance ?  Speaker2:  ok . you haven ’ t seen my company car , have you ?  Speaker1:  no . let me take a look . . . it ’ s longer than my car . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  i think it ’ s over five meters long . i can ’ t remember exactly . it has a maximum speed of over 200 kilometers an hour .

Speaker1:  the advertised rate is based on double occupancy .  Speaker2:  when i booked the room , your staff didn ’ t mention this . and the brochure and your promotional mailings do not mention that .  Speaker1:  are you quite sure ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  yes . have a look . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  i see . i had no idea our advertising was so misleading . it is here , but it ’ s in the fine print on the last page .  Speaker2:  perhaps you could arrange to provide me with a new bill that reflects the advertised rate .  Speaker1:  normally i couldn ’ t do that . but under the circumstances , i ’ ll see what i can arrange . customer satisfaction is our primary aim .

Speaker1: do you have much experience with kids ?  Speaker2:  yes . i have three sons . actually i also have a grandson . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  to tell you the truth , sometimes i regret having a baby so early . i have been making so many sacrifices just because my husband insisted on keeping the baby .  Speaker2:  i understand . i was in your position before . at that time i couldn ’ t depend on anyone taking care of the children for me . my husband seldom stayed at home .  Speaker1:  what about your mother ? did she help you ?  Speaker2:  yes , she did a little . but you see , americans are different from chinese . you can ’ t depend on your own mother to be a full - time babysitter . she could baby - sit only once or twice a week . that ’ s it . i had to care for them most of the time .  Speaker1:  i see . so if my little family goes to america , i would end up taking care of my child all the time . my husband would have to make the bread for us . i just don ’ t know how i would get some education and be able to get a job some day .  Speaker2:  don ’ t worry . you can take night classes . i did that when i had kids . and soon your child will be old enough to attend kindergarten . then you could find a job and work .  Speaker1:  sounds not so easy to me . when that happens , i will be too old to learn .
 | 
Speaker1: now i know why i split up with mike . we found we were simply not good for each other .  Speaker2:  in what ways ?  Speaker1:  well , he is a typical sagittarius guy , while i am a cancer . we aren ' t really compatible  Speaker2:  ha - ha , so you believe in astrology ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  what ' s strange about that ! as a person born under the sign of cancer , i am home - loving and wish for a peaceful family life . but according to astrology , sagittarius guys are too adventurous and risk - taking . they seldom think of leading a settled and peaceful life .  Speaker2:  is that so ? i ' m afraid it is too narrow - minded to judge people using astrology . it ' s all stereotypes !  Speaker1:  but in my case , the fact matches the theory . mike is humorous , energetic , always as fresh as a daisy , but probably too ambitious . it frightens me !

Speaker2:  well , i don ' t know .  Speaker1:  let me tell you the story . in 1892 , patty smith hill and mildred hill wrote a song called ' good morning to you ' . but later someone added the words ' happy birthday ' to their tune .

Speaker2:  i know . i could not believe it when i got hit by that storm . it was pouring with rain all afternoon .  Speaker1:  we really have some movable weather sometime . i wish i would live somewhere which were sunning all year round .  Speaker2:  if it was sunning all year round there would be drought . you probably would not like it either .  Speaker1:  i guess you are right . maybe i just wish the weather could be a little more predictable .

Speaker1:  you know what . the theater guild is supposed to call me and discuss a contract for my play . they are supposed to call me this evening . if i don ' t have a phone . oh , what can i do ?  Speaker2:  well , the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast .  Speaker1:  do you have a cell phone ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  no . i hate cell phones . but you could go to a neighbor ' s house and use their phone .  Speaker1:  can you drive me ? i will go to ann ' s house . it isn ' t far . i can call the theater guild from there and give them her number . she will let us wait in her living room .  Speaker2:  yes , of course i can drive you . so you don ' t want to get your phone fixed right away ?  Speaker1:  yes , i do . at ann ' s house i will call the phone company and have them check my line . if they can fix it right away without coming to my house , then we ' ll just return here . but if not , i need to wait at ann ' s house to talk with the theater guild . it ' s very important to me .

Speaker1:  what methods do you use to conserve water ?  Speaker2:  water is rationed . we can only use a certain amount each month . it means that we cannot use some modern household items , like washing machines . they use too much water .  Speaker1:  i see . i think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution .  Speaker2:  yes , i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course , my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .

Speaker1: so kim , have you ever had anything stolen ?  Speaker2:  stolen ? no , why ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  my uncle just had his motorcycle stolen a few nights ago . i was just thinking about how clever criminals are these days .  Speaker2:  criminals are clever ? they ’ re only successful when people are careless .  Speaker1:  i don ’ t know . the ones who stole my uncle ’ s motorcycle were pretty good .  Speaker2:  if your uncle had an alarm system , then it wouldn ’ t have happened .  Speaker1:  he did . it was one of the best ones available . but that didn ’ t stop them from disabling it . and on a crowded street too .  Speaker2:  didn ’ t anyone stop them ?  Speaker1:  you would think that people would be smart enough to stop something like that . no one knew his motorcycle was being stolen . the thieves came in a truck and convinced everybody that my uncle was parked illegally and they were there to tow it away .

Speaker2:  sounds practical ! to be honest , sometimes i feel puzzled about my future career . i am not sure if this job suits me the best though i work very hard on it and enjoy being a hard worker . i have always wanted to try something else and learn some new skills .  Speaker1:  making a decision to start over is not an easy thing to do . it seems that you need this course more than i do . i love my current job . if i take this course , i hope to learn some tricks to get myself more organized at work . if they can give suggestions about how to boost work relationships , that will be great . i need these to improve my current work performance .

Speaker1:  i have a small family . they are my parents , my younger brother and me .  Speaker2:  i thought you were the only child in the family . didn ' t china practice the only - child policy in the early 1980s ?  Speaker1:  yes , it did . but my parents are ethnic minority people . it ' s a preferential policy for an ethnic minority family to have two children .  Speaker2:  interesting . what do you think about families with only one child ?  Speaker1:  the child must feel very longly . my younger brother is 10 years younger than me . before he was born , i used to be the only child and always dreamed that i would have a younger sister or brother one day .  Speaker2:  do you get along well with each other ?  Speaker1:  yes , we are very close . he is 12 years old now and very smart . he always makes us laugh a lot .

 | 
Speaker1: who is your favorite music composer ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  i don ' t have one single favorite , but these days i listen to a lot of chopin .  Speaker1:  then you must despise such modern music as rock ?

Speaker1:  is she american ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  yeah , and most importantly , she ' s single ! man , i could tell from the moment i saw her , she ' s the girl of my dreams !  Speaker1:  so i take it you two are hitting it off ? i know it ' s very convenient to be in a relationship with your neighbor , but what if you break up ?  Speaker2:  i don ' t know . i am not really worried about that . i don ' t wanna lose before even starting . besides i think the other two american guys have also fallen for her .  Speaker1:  sounds like you ' ve got some competition . you made a move already ?  Speaker2:  not yet . but i am thinking of inviting her to dinner sometime . i know some good restaurants nearby .  Speaker1:  that ' s nice . having been here a little while surely gives you the advantage , eh ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  you bet . now that you mentioned it , i think i ' ll call her now and see if she is available tonight .

Speaker1:  you ’ d better give up smoking . it ’ s bad for your health .  Speaker2:  you ’ re right . but you know it ’ s so hard to give up the old habit like smoking .  Speaker1:  but you should make up your mind first .  Speaker2:  you know i often have to work far into the night . i need smoking to keep me awake .  Speaker1:  why don ’ t you go to bed early and get up early ? you ’ ll have the same time for work .
 | 
Speaker1: oh !  Speaker2:  what fools we were ! _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  to think of it ! all my old silver ! it meant so much to me .  Speaker2:  and my new car . to think that he simply drove off with everything in my car . that ' s what hurts me most .  Speaker1:  what ' s so terrible too , is the fools we ' ve made of ourselves .  Speaker2:  i hardly dare call the police . they ' ll just laugh at us .  Speaker1:  i ' ll never get over it . oh , harry , it was all so unnecessary . that man ! ! how could he do this to us after we ' d put him up ?
 | 
Speaker1: i just saw something about mary last night . it was hilarious . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  david took me to it last week . i thought it was a little sick .  Speaker1:  what do you mean sick ? it was really funny , don ' t you think ?  Speaker2:  it was entertaining in some ways . but in general i didn ' t like it .  Speaker1:  why not ?  Speaker2:  i just think the humor was too gross . there were too many disgusting things in it . i don ' t think a comedy has to have so much smut to be funny .  Speaker1:  it wasn ' t a dirty movie . there wasn ' t even any nudity .  Speaker2:  no , you ' re right . but nudity doesn ' t bother me . what bothered me were all the jokes about masturbation , stuff like that . it was too sick .  Speaker1:  oh , you are too conservative . it ' s just realistic .
 | 
Speaker1: do you know how to go to the fragrant hills in beijing ? i heard that they are very famous in china .

 | 
Speaker1: have you heard that tom and his wife divorced ?  Speaker2:  i didn ' t hear that . but i can deduce the reason .  Speaker1:  really ? say it ! _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  tom is a kind guy , but addicted to gambling . he spends all his time gambling in the casino . and his wife can ' t put up with his incessant gambling any longer , so she divorced him . is that right ?  Speaker1:  yeah , quite right . gambling broke up a happy family .  Speaker2:  yeah ! gambling is often a curse . by gambling we lose time and treasure , two things most precious to a man .  Speaker1:  besides that , many people took to gambling and got in over their heads , and gradually ruined themselves .

Speaker2:  yes , it was really stupid .  Speaker1:  and how much did it cost to rent it ?  Speaker2:  it was fifty dollars for a half - hour . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  well , that ' s not too bad then .
 | 
Speaker1: how ' s your girlfriend ?

 | 
Speaker1: you didn ’ t show up in the morning meeting . what ’ s up ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  well , i just came in . i worked overtime yesterday . some statistics and very important documents seemed to be inaccurate . so i stayed to double check them . the boss was aware of my very late work of last night . so before he left office , he told me i could come one hour later this morning .  Speaker1:  but you still look a little bit tired . what time did you leave ?  Speaker2:  it was around one thirty in the morning . i guess i didn ’ t fall asleep till 3 because those numbers were involving in my mind . i just couldn ’ t stop thinking about them .  Speaker1:  that ’ s normal after a tense work evening . working overtime is not always a pleasant experience for me either . once , i worked overtime everyday for a whole week including the weekend . that really broke my rhythm and i got a little sick later .
 | 
Speaker1: hi ! it ' s still seven o ' clock . are you crazy ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  i got the information that there is a killer sale at the shopping mall near our block . get up and i will wait for you at the gate of our flat .  Speaker1:  every time when you glimpse some stylish clothes , you change into another person . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  stop complaining , ok ?  Speaker1:  no wonder you are named shopaholic .
 | 
Speaker1: what ' s wrong , bob ?  Speaker2:  i was wondering if you could company me to the ball ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  of course , i will .

Speaker2:  things were different this time . i sat by a math genius . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker1:  huh ? you mean you snuck a peek at his test ?
 | 
Speaker1: i can ' t decide whether to go to university or to get a job .  Speaker2:  well , if i were you , i ' d go on studying .  Speaker1:  but i don ' t even know what to study .  Speaker2:  if i had chance again , i ' d major in english . you ' re good at language .  Speaker1:  that ' s what my parents want me to do . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  you should take their advice . they know what ' s best for you . but my friends will have jobs and lots of fun , while i spend all my time doing reading and writing .  Speaker1:  but if you go to university , you ' ll still have time for fun .  Speaker2:  hm , what you say makes sense . but you know , i still have to ask my parents for pocket money , and i hate to do so at this age .  Speaker1:  and if you try to find a part - time job , you ' ll have some money too .
 | 
Speaker1: well , i can ’ t believe your uncle and aunt came to stay with us for a week , and they did not even call us in advance . _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  john , they are old - fashioned people from the chinese countryside . that ’ s their custom .  Speaker1:  i know , but it is hard for me to get used to your relatives coming to visit us , and without warning .  Speaker2:  don ’ t your relatives visit other relatives ?  Speaker1:  yes , but americans never visit without calling in advance , and they almost never stay overnight .
 |

Speaker2:  yes . i like the dress . it must be the latest fashion . look , the hem has lowered , and the waist narrowed .  Speaker1:  it makes me feel rather shabby . that woman has a good taste in dressing , i would say .  Speaker2:  yes . she dressed with an individual flair . i rather envy her .  Speaker1:  most women follow fashion like sheep . they don ' t know any better than imitate .  Speaker2:  i quite agree with you . see the woman there ? i dare say she hasn ' t got any eyes . how could she match the mauve gown with the green handbag ? and all that jewelry !  Speaker1:  the gown is quite expensive , believe me .  Speaker2:  so what ? it only makes her look cheap and vulgar .  Speaker1:  you know those upstarts . they ' re all show - offs ! i think i ' d better have a diet ; otherwise i ' d look like a ballon soon .  Speaker2:  you ' re quite slim . in fact , if you were one of those starlets , the movie company would say you have a fabulous figure .  Speaker1:  thanks . i ' m flattered .

Speaker1:  yes , in all these four sports . the chinese olympic dream teams led the way . they swept the floor against their opponents in table tennis and diving .  Speaker2:  then what are the westerners fit for ?

Speaker1: hi , lucy , you are very popular with people around you , what are your tricks ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  thank you for saying so . i don ’ t know , probably because i like sharing my experience and knowledge with them . i think this kind of communication helps to improve our work efficiency and also helps to get along with colleagues .

Speaker1: what ' s wrong ? _sent_trans_cons_label Speaker2:  i have a headache . these past few days i ' ve been living off painkillers . man , i feel like my head is going to explode .  Speaker1:  you should get acupuncture treatment . my mom was always having headache issues and it was acupuncture that cured her .  Speaker2:  the results are too slow . on top of that , just the thought of smoking needles poking into my flesh frightens me .  Speaker1:  they don ' t just randomly stick you , they find your pressure points . the heat allows the body to immediately respond to the treatment , restoring the body ' s " chi " .  Speaker2:  but i get scared the moment i see a needle . how could i stand having needles in my body for hours on end ?  Speaker1:  the needles are very thin , and as long as the doctor ' s technique is good , and the patient himself is relaxed , it won ' t hurt - on the contrary it will actually alleviate pain . now there are high - tech needles that are micro thin ; they don ' t hurt at all . however , if you are really scared of acupuncture , scraping or cupping are also options .  Speaker2:  scraping is too terrifying . when they finish scrapping , your body is all red , as if you were just tortured . cupping is the same , your body ends up with red circles all over . it looks like someone beat you up .  Speaker1:  this only signifies that the toxins have left the body . actually , there is only discomfort during the treatment process . once it ' s over you feel very comfortable .  Speaker2:  chinese medicine is strange . the patients are already ill , and then the doctor makes them suffer more .  Speaker1:  this is the only way to get at the problem . anyway , if you want to relieve the pain , you are just going to have to be tough and do it .
