if you can choose , will you marry a foreigner or a chinese ? <sep> why ? did tom pop the question ? <sep> not yet . but i wonder if i can get my parents ’ consent . <sep> let me guess , your parents want you to marry a chinese man , right ? <sep> you are right . it is giving me a real headache . i feel like i ’ m between a rock and a hard place . <sep> i used to have the same problem when i was with my ex . <sep> oh , how did you deal with it ? <sep> i just let it go and continued dating with my korean boyfriend . but finally we broke up . <sep> oh , it ’ s a pity . what was the matter ? <sep> simple . we had personality clashes and there were too many cultural differences . <sep> like what ? <sep> he hoped to live in the korean way and asked me to give up working and stay at home to take care of the family . <sep> oh , i see . in their culture women should put family first . <sep> yes , he said it would be better for me and for the whole family . but i simply can not quit working . <sep> so that ' s why it ’ s hard to have a happy marriage with a foreigner .

i ' ve heard so much about japan . is it a beautiful country ? <sep> not everyone thinks japan is beautiful , but to me its beauty is breathtaking . you feel the same way about france , don ' t you ? <sep> yes , i do feel the same way about france . the swift rivers , the fertile valleys , the large cities - its scenery is beautiful . will you describe the geography of japan ? <sep> well , it ' s made up of four large islands and many smaller islands located off the coast of the asian main lands . france isn ' t an island , is it ? <sep> oh , no , france isn ' t an island . it is located in the western part of the european continent . but france does have many fine harbors and port cities on its southern and western coasts . does japan have good harbors ? <sep> good harbors ! yokohama is one of the most famous port cities in the world , and japan is the largest shipbuilding nation in the world . also , there are long mountain ranges in the southern is hands . france isn ' t very mountainous , is it ? <sep> no , france isn ' t very mountainous . but it does contain the pyrenees , a large mountain range with high peaks and deep canyons . what kind of climate does japan have ? <sep> the japanese climate is warm and moist in the south , mild in the central part and cold in the north . except for hokkaido , we don ' t get much snowfall at all . france has a mild climate , doesn ' t it ? <sep> yes , the climate of france rarely has severe winters . in southern france , one can live in comfort the whole year . is japan good for farming ? <sep> yes , japan is good for farming . rice is the main crop , but japan is also an industrial center . fishing is very important , too . rice isn ' t grown in france , is it ? <sep> no , rice isn ' t grown in france . but farming , fishing and industry are also very important in france . i ' d like to go to japan some day . would you like to visit france ?

you like movies ? <sep> yeah , i think it ' s the best way to relax . <sep> what type do you like the best ? <sep> really it depends on my mood . when i am sad or depressed , i like comedies . if i ' m feeling good , i ' ll watch almost anything . <sep> i see . i generally like movies to help calm me down . i think a sign of a good movie is the ability to bring you into the story as if you were part of it . <sep> yeah , unfortunately , nowadays directors are often more interested in making money than making a good film . <sep> true . the movie industry is becoming more and more commercial . you see a lot of expensive movies with little artistic value . i generally think those made in the forties are of higher quality on the average than movies today . you can name a lot of classics from that decade .
office software like windows might be one of the best inventions in this information age . it saves us from so much work and makes the communication even around the world much easier . <sep> fully agree . i do enjoy the convenience though i am still a beginner in using excel . the latest office equipment is more type - functional . it combines fax machine , copy machine and printer in one . it saves a lot of place one machine instead of three . <sep> yes , this machine is even smaller than those before .

millions of amateur investors like you , have to rely on a dizzying array of financial newspapers , magazines and commentators to get investment information . <sep> yes . it ' s sometimes scary if you think of the tremendous amount of media we face every day . <sep> it ' s like information overload , not to mention the reliability of these papers and magazines . <sep> which financial magazines and newspapers do you think do the best job of checking facts ? <sep> well , for example , the wall street journal is very , very good . even though it ' s used on occasion ( as all news organizations are ) by ces or bankers who leak their mergers in advance in order to get a positive spin . <sep> i like to read fortune . <sep> good . fortune is usually ahead of the curve . and business week is very solid , too . <sep> where does a broadcast company get most of their information ? i hope it ' s not just from press releases . <sep> a good broadcast company usually does far more than press releases . their people go out and do real reporting , talking to people at the stock exchange , fund managers , analysts , etc .

what ' s the news on our website ? how effective do you think it is from a marketing standpoint ? <sep> we ' ve been able to survey and track some of the information of our website users through some cookie technology , and it ' s surprising to see the results . <sep> what kinds of hits are we getting on our company ' s website ? <sep> from the numbers , it seems nearly half of the visitors who stumble onto our page pick up the link not from network browsers or search engines , but from our circular insert . that means our consumers are purposefully and actively seeking information about our products and services through the web format . based on these findings , i am completely convinced the internet is the marketing power of the future ! <sep> you really think that many people turn to the internet to find product information . what about the old standbys of word mouth and print media ?

how did you choose courses when you were abroad ? <sep> that ' s a very good question . choosing proper courses and effectively planning a college schedule is very important to the progress toward your educational goal . in order to do these wisely and effectively , you should consult with a program adviser or academic counselor . <sep> wait a minute . there are some new terms for me . i can hardly follow you . <sep> ok , i will go into more detail . a program adviser or an academic counselor is usually an experienced professor who is responsible for all the necessary academic counseling through graduation . you can discuss with him the program selection , changing or adding a program , the requirements for graduation , and other problems related to your study . you will choose some courses , and then discuss with the adviser whether your choice can meet the requirements for graduation . <sep> everything is so new to me . i think i ' ll have to experience a very difficult period when i get there . <sep> sure , very difficult . <sep> i am very grateful for your advice .

shall we go to cinema this evening ? the new blockbuster starring mel gibson is showing . it ’ s supposed to be really good . <sep> what kind of movie is it ? i don ’ t like many of his movies , actually . <sep> it ’ s a thriller . it has julia roberts playing the female lead . <sep> i like thrillers and i like julia roberts , so it might be interesting . i read a review today and the critic didn ’ t seem to be very impressed . <sep> what did the critic say ? <sep> he didn ’ t say it was bad , but he said that it wasn ’ t as good as it could have been , particularly as there were some good actors and actresses in it . <sep> the movie starts at eight o ’ clock , so we have plenty of time to eat and get ready .
mom , i just finished my paper . can you proofread it before i hand it in ? <sep> sure , let ’ s take a look . sweetie , this is terrific . your ideas are so original . <sep> thanks . <sep> i can tell you worked hard on it . <sep> i really did ! i started thinking about what i wanted to say three weeks ago .
you know . . . i did very poorly on that test . <sep> cheer up ! it ' s not the only chance in life to do well on a test . there ' ll be many more . <sep> well , you know how i am about exams . i ' m a perfectionist .
i haven ' t met the smiths for a long time . <sep> they have moved to chicago . <sep> why ?
the performance is amazing . i ' m curious about how they did it . i mean the way they sing . <sep> they must have practiced a lot . the perseverance has made them they are today . <sep> so cool . someone gave me this flier at the exit . what ' s it about ? <sep> let me have a look . well , it lists some shows that will be on next week . <sep> oh , tell me about it . anything interesting ? <sep> hmm . . . oh , this one , ' the drunken beauty ' . this is a real classic . <sep> ' the drunken beauty ' ? it ' s funny that we have ' sleeping beauty ' in my country . anyway , what ' s it about ? is the beauty a drunkard ? <sep> of course not . she was said to be the most beautiful woman in her time and that made her become the queen . they play was famous for its singing and dancing . <sep> sure , people do that when they are drunk . what about the actress ? <sep> she is an opera star in china . her teacher ' s teacher is mei landfang . <sep> oh , i ' ve heard about him before . he even created a special dance of sleeve shaking . <sep> you are such an expert on it . i don ' t know that . <sep> you know , interest is the best teacher . <sep> so , want me to book the tickets again ? <sep> please do that . i can ' t wait to come back again . the performance must be really amazing .
hi , why do you look so depressed today , mike ? <sep> i had a terrible quarrel with my neighbor yesterday . <sep> how come ? <sep> it is a long story . basically , she thought i had laughed at her while i didn ' t . <sep> i know everyone suffers when he is misunderstood . but why not take it easy ?
could you help me ? <sep> what do you need ? <sep> i can ' t seem to find my class . <sep> what building is it in ? <sep> it ' s in the c building . <sep> oh , i know exactly where that is . <sep> do you think you can tell me where it is ? <sep> sure , what room number is it ? <sep> it ' s room number 261 . <sep> i have a class around there right now . <sep> could you show me where it is ?
i ' m sure he was off - side . <sep> but the ref didn ' t whistle . <sep> i think he favors the host team .
did you get the car you wanted ? <sep> no . someone had stolen a march on me and bought it . <sep> what about the car over there ?
what are you doing ? <sep> what am i doing ? what am i doing ? don ’ t you know what day it is ? <sep> mumm . no . <sep> it ’ s only the day when the world ’ s biggest sporting event is kicking off . <sep> what ? <sep> the world cup ! the first match is today ! it ’ s mexico vs . south africa ! it ’ s going to be a really good match ! both teams have a very strong offense and have skilled players . i think that south africa will probably dominate the first half since they are the host country , and all . <sep> i have no idea what you ’ re talking about . the only sporting event we watch at home is the super bowl . <sep> this is bigger than the super bowl , man ! teams from 32 countries compete against each other every four years and fight to win that trophy . they first start in a group stage with bigger groups , each group having 4 teams . the top 2 teams pass on to an elimination stage before going on to the quarter final sand semifinals . <sep> sounds interesting , but soccer doesn ’ t really appeal to me . <sep> are you kidding ? over seven hundred million people watched the final match of the world cup ! it ’ s a very exciting and nerve wracking sport ! each nation is cheering on their team , hoping they will become the next champion . so far brazil is the team with the most titles under their belt ; they ’ re really good ! <sep> all i know about soccer is that you can ’ t use your hands and that players are always falling down , trying to get a free kick or penalty kick . it seems like a sissy sport to me !
you look so happy , anna . any good news ? <sep> yes . i ’ ve won the first prize in the math contest . <sep> really ? congratulations ! <sep> thank you , paul . <sep> by the way , would you like to have dinner with me tomorrow evening ? tomorrow is my birthday . <sep> good , happy birthday to you ! <sep> not so soon . it ’ s not my birthday today . well , you ’ ll come , won ’ t you ?

it ' s very thoughtful of you to invite me to your wedding . <sep> how can i forget my old friend ? <sep> my best wishes to you and the bride !
i am very interested in a new apartment near the taxing plaza , but the price is very high , i really can ' t afford it . <sep> how much is it for each square meter ? how large is the apartment ? <sep> it ' s 7500 yuan per square meter , and i really like the one with three bedrooms and a large living room . its total area is about 80 square meters . <sep> that surely will cost you a lot of money . are you going to make a full payment ? <sep> do you think i am rich enough to make it ? i am thinking about buying the apartment by installments . the real estate agency says if i pay a 25 % down payment , i can move in at once .
so , you friend ’ s getting married on saturday . what have you bought her as a wedding gift . i find is so hard to choose the right gift . <sep> my friend and her fiance had a really good idea . they have cut out pictures from catalogues and pasted them in a notebook . the picture are of things they want . people sign their name by the item they will buy . <sep> that ’ s clever ! then everyone knows that they are buying something the couple really want and there ’ s no chance of two people buying the same gift . what things were in the notebook ? <sep> most of the things were household appliance . you know , everything from an iron through a vacuum cleaner to a cooker . i think it ’ s an excellent way for everyone who knows the couple to help them set up home . <sep> so , what did you get them ? <sep> i bought a sewing machine . i know that my friend likes making her own clothes , but her current sewing machine is quite old and has some problems . <sep> what ’ s wrong with it ? <sep> she says that after several years of use , it ’ s not working properly . when she uses it , it makes a funny noise . <sep> household appliance don ’ t seem to last for a long time nowadays .
do you often go to watch sports games ? <sep> i go occasionally when there ' s a game on near home , but usually i watch it on tv . <sep> can you recall the games ?
when do children start school in your country ? <sep> normally at six . before that , they spend several years in the kindergarten or pre - school education center . <sep> but thats only in the cities , isnt it ? <sep> right . in the countryside , things are more complicated . <sep> can kids in the countryside get equally good benefits and education like those in the cities ?
hello michael . <sep> hello todd . <sep> we ' re going to talk about australia . or your going to talk about australia . so first of all how any people live in australia ? <sep> australia ? oh , there ' s about twenty million people in australia right now . a little bit under , but close to twenty . <sep> ok . what are the biggest cities ? <sep> the biggest city ? the biggest city is sydney , then it ' s followed by melbourne and then brisbane and then i think it ' s perth . but most of the big cities are on the east coast of australia . and perth is on the west coast , but sort of of out there by itself . <sep> ok . um , if you had to live in one place where would you live ? <sep> i like brisbane . i had my teenage years in brisbane , growing up in brisbane , um or maybe sidney because it is a big city , but brisbane has got the gold coast and the sunshine . <sep> oh , nice . actually , what is the capital city of australia ?
how is he ? <sep> not very well . he was white about the gills . <sep> did he see the doctor ? <sep> yeah , but he refused to take the medicine . <sep> why ?

why are you shivering ?
what do you think of the way people use and treat animals ? <sep> i think most people treat animals well , but we are often cruel to animals . when we raise animals for food , the conditions they live in are often poor . <sep> perhaps people should stop eating animals . we could grow more crops . <sep> what would you do with all the animals ? you couldn ’ t just let them go . besides , some people would still hunt them . meat has become an integral part of our diet . <sep> we could provide them with better conditions anyway . we should certainly try to improve the conditions at zoos . we should try to recreate the natural conditions as much as possible . <sep> that ’ s true . i think zoo are a good idea , because they allow people to get close to animals . i think it ’ s good for kids to see wild animals . <sep> i agree . i ’ m an adult and i love going to the zoo . i don ’ t like animals experiments though . i believe that we can do tests in other ways . <sep> i read that the number of animals being used in experiments is falling dramatically as new techniques are being introduced . <sep> that ’ s good news . the good thing is that most people treat their pets well . <sep> sometimes you read about people who have been cruel to pets or other animals , but those stories are rare . <sep> have you every given money to any of the charities that take care of animals .
i can ' t believe the weather is so gorgeous for your wedding . <sep> yes . it ' s perfect . <sep> and all of the flowers are in bloom .
do you know much about computers ? <sep> not a great deal . <sep> i ' ve just been reading an article about them . they ' ll be used for all sorts of things now . <sep> for accounting system and things like that , you mean ? <sep> yes , but they are used for other things , too . do you remember when we went to buy a ticket for the flight to paris . <sep> yes ? <sep> the man asked where we want to go , then he type out the information on the form and waited for a reply . a few moment later , he gave us two tickets .
jimmy , i ’ d like to wear this robe for tonight cocktail party . what do you think of it ? <sep> don ’ t dress like that . you ’ ll make fool yourself . you look stupid in that robe . <sep> what ? but it is my favorite piece of clothing . <sep> maybe it is . but it ’ s out of fashion . <sep> what am i going to do ?
