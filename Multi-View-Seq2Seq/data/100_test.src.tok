television is undoubtedly a great invention , but one of the main criticisms of it is that people just aren ' t selective enough . lesley , got a television . how do you pick out the sorts ofprogrammes you want to watch ? <sep> i try and look at the programmes that are on to decide which particular ones interest me , rather than you turning it on a seven o ' clock and you leaving it on until half - past eleven when the programmes finish . <sep> do you think of television though as a great time - waster ? <sep> un . . . i think it can be a time - waster and it depends on how particular people are about what they want to see . . . mm , it can just be a sort total amusement for someone and totally consuming without reallyconsidering what it is they ' re watching . <sep> aha , but how do you prevent it coming into your life and taking oversour evenings and at the same time perhaps get . . . get out of thetelevision some of the sort of best things . . . best programmes that . . . that undoubtedly are on television ? <sep> well , i suppose one of the problems is . . . will depend on what a person ' s life style is , and that if he has other outside interests which are equally important to him as television , he will then , you know , hmm . be more careful about which programme she wants to watch because he has time which he wants to use for other things . <sep> do you think though that . . . that in . . . in a sense television skilled people ' s own er . . . sort of , creativity or their ability entertain themselves because if they ' re bored all they do is justturn on the television ?
